<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The author of the study which follows responded to the
lure of his task for both theoretical and practical reasons. He seemed,
because of his intimate personal relationship to Armenian life, to be
peculiarly qualified to study and interpret a cross-section of that
country&rsquo;s life. It is particularly urgent that we as Americans
have authentic studies of Armenia and Armenian social life. Heretofore
there has been a striking lack of such materials readily accessible in
English. Because of the not inconsiderable immigration which reaches us
from Armenia, and because also there has been a call for the United
States to act as mandatory for this country under the peace treaty, we
should penetrate more deeply into the Armenian heart than we have been
able to do so far, if we are to carry through successfully our job
either as assimilator or as friendly guardian. Moreover there is
incumbent upon the United States in particular the duty of
understanding a country like Armenia, since we have been foremost in
proclaiming the doctrine of the rights of small nationalities. Those
are the practical purposes from the standpoint of social politics which
have given rise to and confer full warrant upon this study.</p>
<p>Of no less importance, however, is the contribution which Mr.
Boettiger&rsquo;s study makes to theoretical sociology. He has sketched
out for us the picture of a refractory culture which refuses to
amalgamate with or yield to or be permeated by rival cultures. The
social history of this sturdy people offers us a very clear-cut example
of what really makes a society or a nation. Not mountains, not
dynasties, not blood, but common interests, common traditions, common
beliefs; in short, mental community.</p>
<p>The theoretical joins with the practical service of this study if it
can strengthen our understanding that only as our own blood and that of
our Armenian friends reach the place where they boil at the same
temperature, or are cooled by the same application of reason, can we
minister to each other or carry out the new partnership which may lie
immediately ahead of us in the re&euml;stablishment of peace and the
reorganization of world comity.</p>

<h2 class="main">Introduction</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The study which follows has a very definite objective
apart from the mere gathering of materials, namely, to interpret as far
as the subject-matter would permit, the social life of the Armenian
people. The legends and festivals described have thus been selected
from a larger mass of material with this principle in mind. I have,
therefore, omitted such as seemed to me to be of little or no social
value. Also, in full accordance with this plan, I have chosen to
include certain church ceremonies which give rise to such festivals,
and are of such social importance that I considered them an organic
part of my subject. Otherwise I think I have kept within the strict
confines as indicated by the title of this study.</p>
<p>It must, therefore, be evident that neither Part One on legends, nor
Part Two on festivals, is exhaustive, and this is necessarily so, not
only because of my selective plan, but also because much of the work on
this and kindred subjects has been done by the French, and is available
only on the continent. All of the sources used are, however, original
in two possible constructions of the term; that is, they are the works
of Armenians who have lived for many years in their native land, or of
foreigners, generally French or English, who have traveled through the
country and gathered their material first hand. A large portion of this
matter I have been able to check up and add to through my wife, an
Armenian, who lived in Constantinople most of her life, and who is
naturally versed in the folk-lore of her native land. While this has
been the chief source of my interest, it is not the only one, for
during my three years&rsquo; work in Beirut, Syria, I became acquainted
with many Armenians.</p>
<p>To describe a legend, or a festival, and to tag it Armenian, is
about as purposeful and enlightening as to explain Plato&rsquo;s idea
of social unity to a person who has no picture of Greek civilization. I
have, therefore, found it necessary to fit these legends and festivals
into the particular settings that seemed to me most natural. The
legends that date from pagan times are meaningless apart from their
historical background; the church legends and festivals are without
value apart from their religious-historical setting, while such legends
as those of Ararat require a description of the natural environment to
which they belong. The conclusions and interpretation which this study
gives rise to, as well as the manner in which I have organized and
attempted to weave the material together into a unified fabric, are my
own.</p>
<p>Most of the books used have been supplied by the Case Memorial
Library of Hartford Theological Seminary, and I owe the Reverend M. H.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb2" href="#pb2" name=

gracious co&ouml;peration in suggesting materials and providing me with
them. I am also deeply indebted to Professor J. W. Beach for his
painstaking criticism and valuable suggestions, and for the corrections
and suggestions offered by Professor W. S. Davis and Professor A. E.
Jenks. To Professor A. J. Todd I am especially grateful, for it was
under his direction and supervision that this study was carried
out.</p>

<h2 class="main">The Geography of Armenia</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Armenia is a huge plateau, a westward extension of the
great Iranian highland, bounded by the Caucasus Mountains on the north,
the Taurus Mountains and Kurdistan on the south, the Persian lowlands
on the southeast, and the Black and Caspian seas. The average height of
the plateau is 6,000 feet. As it ends abruptly at the Black Sea on one
side, so on the other it breaks down in rugged terraces to the
Mesopotamian lowlands; on the east it sinks gradually to the lower
levels of Persia, and on the west to the plains of Asia Minor. The
chief mountain ranges run from northeast to southwest, rising above the
general level of the plateau to an altitude ranging from 8,000 to
12,000 feet and culminating in Ararat, the lofty summit of which stands
17,000 feet above sea level. Broad, elevated, and fertile valleys range
themselves between the mountains, the main lines of which are
determined by the four chief rivers of the country, the Tigris, the
Euphrates, the Aras, and the Kur. All four rise in the plateau, the two
former emptying into the Persian Gulf, and the latter two into the
Caspian Sea. The Euphrates divides the country into what is known as
great and little Armenia, or Armenia major and Armenia minor, Armenia
major on the east and Armenia minor on the west. Although the valleys
are generally broad expanses of arable land, grass covered and
treeless, the gorges of the Euphrates and Tigris can not be surpassed
in grandeur and wildness. The winters are long and severe, and the
summers short, dry, and hot. In the city of Erzerum the range of
temperature is from -22&deg; to 84&deg;, and snow is usually present in
June.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e600src" href="#xd20e600" name=
"xd20e600src">1</a></p>
<p>In consequence of the long and severe winters the villages are built
on gentle slopes of the hillsides in which the houses are excavated.
Robert Curzon, who traveled through the country about 1850, has written
the best description of them.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e611src" href=
"#xd20e611" name="xd20e611src">2</a> A rectangular plot of ground about
the size of an English acre is laid out and excavated to a depth of
seven or eight feet at the back side, decreasing gradually with the
slope of the hill to a depth of about two feet. After a careful
leveling of the ground, trunks of straight trees are cut and arranged
in rows for the support of the ceiling, which consists of cross-beams
interspersed by a wooden frame-work upon which the removed soil is laid
to a considerable thickness. The walls are made of stone. In entering
the habitation at the lower slope of the hillside, one is obliged to
descend three or four steps to the outer door, which <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb6" href="#pb6" name="pb6">6</a>]</span>opens to a
passage six to ten feet in length, at the end of which is a second
door, constructed of wood like the first. This door swings to through
the operation of a curious wooden weight passed over a kind of pulley,
in order to keep the outside cold from entering the inner chamber. The
inside of the door is usually covered with a rough, red-dyed goatskin.
Directly before the inner door is a wooden platform raised some two
feet above the ground and known in Turkish as the
&ldquo;Salamlik,&rdquo; the hall of reception of the head of the
family. Chairs and tables it possesses none, only divans richly draped
with Kurdish stuffs placed against the stone walls that bound the two
sides of the platform. The floor is carpeted with tekeke, a kind of
grey felt, and the walls are decorated with swords, knives, pistols,
and other weapons. On the other two sides, the Salamlik is bounded by
wooden rails to keep away the sheep and cattle which occupy the
greatest proportion of floor space, and whose breathing helps
materially to keep the chamber warm. The other members of the household
are confined behind the stone wall where the space is sometimes split
up into two or more chambers for the various families of the
patriarchal household. One of these rooms is the common eating-room,
and is provided with an open hearth, fireplace, and chimney which leans
forward over the fireplace and draws up the smoke through a hole in the
turf-covered roof. A great stone is placed over the chimney to keep
children at play and grazing animals from falling through. In traveling
through the country on horseback, particular care must be taken lest
the horse step through an old chimney hole and break his leg. The
windows are funnel shaped holes through the ceiling spanned with oiled
paper.</p>
<p>Such is the Armenian household in which the people live day and
night during eight winter months of the year in the coldest section of
the country, as Erzerum and Mush. That many of the evenings were passed
in listening to the tales and gossip of a wandering minstrel, or to the
legends and folk-beliefs of the grey-haired members of the family,
there can be no doubt. That the national tradition was passed on in
this manner from the aged to the younger, to be again passed on in
their turn, is a matter of as much certainty as that part at least of
this same tradition has been preserved through the continually
recurring storms of the passing centuries. The recounting of national
legends and folk-lore is a chief means of amusement even in the warmer
sections of the country, where the climate makes a free community life
possible. How much more place, then, must it have had in these colder
sections where only the head of the family ever left the household in
winter-time, and then only in case of absolute necessity.</p>
<p>As has been suggested, this style of dwelling-place is not common to
all parts of Armenia. In some places the houses are built entirely
above ground, usually of stone, and sometimes, especially in the case
of the poorer inhabitants, of mud. Though the winters are not so long
or severe as in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb7" href="#pb7" name=
"pb7">7</a>]</span>the district of Erzerum, they are nevertheless
sufficiently cold to require a fire six or seven months of the year.
The characteristic feature of every living- and dining-room is the
large &ldquo;toneer&rdquo; or circular fireplace dug out to a depth of
three to four feet in the center of the room. Here the fire is built in
the morning, usually with &ldquo;tezek,&rdquo; the most common variety
of fuel which is a sun-baked mixture of straw and sheep or cow dung.
The bread is baked and the meals are cooked in the &ldquo;toneer&rdquo;
and when it is time to eat, the members sit about the open space,
letting their feet hang over the fire to keep warm. In the hut
described by Montp&egrave;reux, there was but a single opening in the
roof which served for window and chimney at the same time, and which
was often carefully sealed up with straw to keep out the cold.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd20e625src" href="#xd20e625" name="xd20e625src">3</a>
This author has given a clear picture of the common family fireplace
and sleeping chamber in which each person fell asleep as best he might
upon rugs and skins, keeping as near the &ldquo;toneer&rdquo; as
possible. And if the traditions, legends, and folk-lore that will make
up the body of this thesis are the common possession of the people, as
I have reason to believe them to be, in spite of drastic measures taken
to suppress them, how better could they have been told and retold than
while lounging about the &ldquo;toneer&rdquo; during long winter
evenings before sleeping time?<a class="noteref" id="xd20e631src" href=
"#xd20e631" name="xd20e631src">4</a></p>
<p>In what other respects the natural environment of the people moulded
the common life, one can only conjecture. That the cold winters and
deep river valleys have tended to the formation of isolated
communities, clannishness, and provincialism, as is contended by some
writers, has not generally been true. Tidal waves of conquering
civilizations have passed over the country too frequently to make such
an influence possible.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e641src" href=
"#xd20e641" name="xd20e641src">5</a> Furthermore the people are bound
together by a national religion, whose chief officials are chosen by
the lay members and priesthood of the many communities.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd20e644src" href="#xd20e644" name="xd20e644src">6</a>
These representatives to the national religious assemblies return to
their own people brimming with news and reports of political as well as
religious and social matters. Such facts together with a common
ancestry, a common tradition, and a common language have moulded a
nation, and not a thousand differentiated groups among a people who
were once a nation. They have tended to solidify and unify the national
character, and it is just this process of solidification that gives
significance to the whole fabric of beliefs, legends, and festivals of
the people. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb8" href="#pb8" name=
"pb8">8</a>]</span></p>
<p>As a nation, the Armenian people are exclusive, but this is an
entirely different matter. For three years I have had occasion to
observe groups of students belonging to different nations, chiefly
Egyptians, Syrians, Greeks, Jews, Persians, Turks, and Armenians, and
the latter always showed a most persistent determination to confine
their friendships and social intercourse to themselves. Perhaps this is
due to the fact that nearly all of the nations above mentioned have at
one time or another dominated the Armenians; perhaps it is due to the
persecution they have recently suffered, which, though it has been a
sufficiently important fact to result in serious social and
psychological changes, has by no means been characteristic of the
history of the people, as it has been, for example, of the Jews; or
perhaps it is due to the solidarity and oneness of the people as a
whole. I am inclined rather to the latter explanation, and may perhaps
be able to prove it so.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the singularity of the physical environment has placed
its irremovable stamp upon the people. The words that best describe the
country are not trees, hills, forests, gently flowing streams, such
words as commonly express American landscape, but rather, gorges,
mountain ranges, broad river valleys, treeless expanses of country.
There is space to make one think of other worlds and other shores, and
there are mountains suggestive of strength, that rise majestic above
the plateau, to fill one with awe and wonder. Religious the people are
naturally, but more than that, they are thoughtful, reflecting,
considering. No writer that I have read but has spoken of the Armenian
as intellectually alert and capable. That this thoughtfulness, this
robust element in their idealism is in part the stamp of physical
nature, there can be little doubt. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb9"

<h3 class="main">Section 1. The Legend of Haic</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Armenians do not call themselves Armenians nor their
country Armenia. They are descendants of Haic, as the legend goes, who
was the son of Togarmah, the son of Japhet, who was the son of Noah,
and they call their country Haiasdan after the patriarchal progenitor
of their people.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e666src" href="#xd20e666"
name="xd20e666src">1</a> Haic dwelt in the plain of Shinar and was a
prefect or director in the building of the tower of Babel. He was
beautiful as a god and strong as a giant, mighty in battle and
especially adept in spear throwing. In the days of his youth, Bel or
Nimrod, who was the patron god of Babylon, established himself over all
and wished to be worshipped. But Haic refused to obey, and taking his
sons, who numbered about three hundred, his daughters, his sheep and
cattle, he journeyed north until he came to the land of Ararat. Bel
tried in vain to persuade his rival to come back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou hast departed and hast settled in a chill and frosty
region,&rdquo; urged the Assyrian god. &ldquo;Soften thy hard pride,
change thy coldness to geniality; be my subject and come and live a
life of ease in my domain.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd20e674src"
href="#xd20e674" name="xd20e674src">2</a></p>
<p>But Haic refused the cordial invitation, which so much angered Bel
that the latter brought his army to force the Armenian hero into
submission. Haic, however, was victorious, for he slew Bel with an
arrow from his own bow. The place where Bel was buried is called
&ldquo;Kerezman,&rdquo; meaning grave, and is pointed out to this day.
Armenians sing songs and tell stories of the great beauty and valor of
Haic. He died at the age of four hundred in about 2028 B.C.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd20e682src" href="#xd20e682" name=
"xd20e682src">3</a></p>
<p>This oldest of Armenian legends, quaint and simple as it is in
accounting for the beginnings of a people, savours of the Old Testament
and is suggestive of the Assyrian invasion which took place about the
ninth century before Christ. It is significant that the Armenians
refused the protection of Bel, and that in the very beginning of their
legendary history, they insisted on standing firm and maintaining their
independence, for no single quality is more characteristic of this
people than a proud, haughty, even at times disdainful independence. It
is also suggestive that their patriarchal hero was no saint, but a
mighty giant, beautiful as he was strong, whose greatest pride was in
the throwing of a spear, for his descendants have not been a peaceful
people. To be sure, they were the first nation to be converted to
Christianity, which would say little for <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb10" href="#pb10" name="pb10">10</a>]</span>their firmness and
independence, were it not that the priest with the cross was followed
by a powerful king with a sword at the head of an army that had learned
to fight as the Romans fought.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e692src" href=
"#xd20e692" name="xd20e692src">4</a> The songs that were sung in memory
and honor of Haic are seldom sung to-day unless it be in some remote
village where the civilization of the Turk has not yet pressed, and
there are few such villages if any. For many of them breathe of a
national spirit not beseeming a subject nation, and have been
suppressed for many years.</p>

<h3 class="main">Section 2. The Legend of Ara and Semiramis</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Dating back to the Assyrian invasion which took place
during the seventh and eighth centuries before Christ, one of the
oldest of Armenian legends, that of Semiramis, queen of Assyria, and
Ara, king of Armenia, is told.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e700src" href=
"#xd20e700" name="xd20e700src">5</a> Ara was very beautiful, and
Semiramis having heard speech of his beauty for many years, wished to
possess him. But she dared do nothing for fear of Ninus, protector over
Armenia. After the death of Ninus, however, the queen sent messengers
to Ara, with gifts and offerings, with prayers and promises of riches,
begging him to come to her at Nineveh and either wed her and reign over
all that Ninus had possessed, or <span class="corr" id="xd20e710"
title="Source: fulfil">fulfill</span> her desire and return in peace to
Armenia with many gifts. But when the messengers had been turned away
repeatedly, Semiramis became angry, and taking her army she hastened to
Armenia. The battle was fought on the plain of Ara, called after him
Ararat; and although the queen had given careful orders to her generals
to devise some means of saving the life of Ara, the Armenian king was
slain. She found the dead body among the others that had fallen, and
ordered her servants to place it in an upper chamber in her castle. And
when the Armenian army again arose to drive away the foe and avenge the
death of Ara, the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb11" href="#pb11"
name="pb11">11</a>]</span>queen said, &ldquo;I have commanded the gods
to lick his wounds and he shall live again.&rdquo; She tried to bring
Ara back to life by witchcraft and charms, but the body began to decay
and she commanded her servants to cast the corpse into a deep pit and
to cover it. And having dressed up one of her men in secret, she caused
the following proclamation to be spread among the people: &ldquo;The
gods have licked Ara and have brought him back to life again, thus
fulfilling our prayers and our pleasures. Therefore from this time
forth shall they be the more glorified and worshipped by us, for they
are the givers of joy and the fulfillers of desire.&rdquo; And she
erected a statue to the gods, making it seem as though they had brought
Ara back to life again. This news was spread over all the country of
Armenia, and having satisfied the people, she put an end to the
fighting. The twelve-year-old son of the king was taken by the Assyrian
queen and appointed ruler over Armenia. She called him Ara, in memory
of her love for Ara the Beautiful.</p>
<p>To Semiramis is attributed the building of the ancient city of Van
on the shores of the beautiful lake of Van, where she made her summer
residence until the time of her departure.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e717src" href="#xd20e717" name="xd20e717src">6</a> She might well
have lingered there, for the Armenians have a proverb, &ldquo;Van in
this world, paradise in the next.&rdquo; Nevertheless, Semiramis and
Ara are mythical characters, although the latter is spoken of in the
history of St. Martin as having lived along about 1769 B.C.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd20e723src" href="#xd20e723" name="xd20e723src">7</a> As
regards the popular belief in the legend, however, there is not the
slightest doubt. This is proved by the fact that even to-day the city
is called &ldquo;Sham-iram-agerd&rdquo; by the Armenians, meaning the
city of Semiramis. Lynch says that Ara and Semiramis are Tannuz and
Istar, the Adonis and the Aphrodite of the Hellenic myth, and that the
quest of the Assyrian queen may be connected with the introduction into
Armenia of the worship of Istar whose name is mentioned in one of the
cuneiform inscriptions at Van.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e726src" href=
"#xd20e726" name="xd20e726src">8</a> However, the results of modern
scholarship are by no means conclusive on this point, as we shall

<h3 class="main">Section 3. Historical Background of the Legend of Ara
and Semiramis</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Moses&rsquo; history was read by St. Martin who became
exceedingly interested in Van, and in the cuneiform inscriptions spoken
of. It was due to him that the French government dispatched a mission
to Armenia in 1827, under the direction of a young German Professor,
Friedrich Edward Schulz. Schulz was murdered by the Kurds, a thing
which rarely happens in Armenia, and his work was left incomplete. He
had succeeded, however, in making copies of forty-two inscriptions,
which were published <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb12" href="#pb12"
name="pb12">12</a>]</span>in 1840, and proved to be remarkably
accurate. Shortly afterward, orientalists made great discoveries in the
Mesopotamian valley, but the inscriptions at Van did not tally with any
syllabaries discovered up to that time, nor could they be translated in
any known language. A number of them were found to be Assyrian, but the
great majority were peculiar to Van, and entirely baffled the students.
Not until 1880 were they finally unravelled. M. S. Guyard discovered at
that time that the concluding phrase of many Vannic texts represented
an imprecatory formula found in exactly the same place in Assyrian
counterparts. This discovery enabled Professor Sayce, of Oxford, to
decipher the inscriptions at a rapid rate.</p>
<p>Among the important facts discovered were that the nation was a
rival nation of Assyria, and that its people were called Khaldeans, or
children of Khaldis, much in the same way as the Assyrians reflected
the name of their god, Assur. The country was a theocracy and Khaldis
was supreme. In the tablets, his wrath was invoked against whomever
should destroy them. The capital city was Dhuspus, modern Van, which is
the Disp, or Tsp of Armenian writers, and the Turuspa of Assyrian
annals. The Assyrians styled the kingdom Urardhu, or Urarthu, which is
the name appearing in the Bible in the familiar form Ararat.</p>
<p>The earliest inscriptions date back to the ninth century before
Christ, and as the language is neither Semitic nor Indo-European, the
people could neither have been Assyrians whose language was Semitic,
nor Armenians, whose language is Indo-European. The first mention made
of Urardhu was in the reign of Ashur-Nazir-Pal (885&ndash;860 B.C.)
whose successor, Shalmanasar II (860&ndash;825 B.C.) was the first
Assyrian king to invade Armenia.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e740src"
href="#xd20e740" name="xd20e740src">9</a> Raffi, however, (the son of
the famous Armenian poet) speaks of an account given by
Assur-Nazir-Haban (1882&ndash;1857 B.C.) of one of his victories.
&ldquo;They&rdquo; (i.e., the people of Ararat or Urarthu), he said,
&ldquo;fled to the impregnable mountains so that I might not be able to
get at them, for the mighty summits were like drawn swords pointing to
the skies. Only the birds of heaven soaring on their wings could reach
them. In three days I was there spreading terror in places where they
had taken refuge. Their corpses like autumn leaves filled the clefts.
The rest escaped to distant inaccessible heights.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd20e746src" href="#xd20e746" name="xd20e746src">10</a>
This, clearly, is a much older record than any that Lynch found trace
of, and although Raffi cites no authority for the quotation, I presume
that it has been taken from a recent discovery. If this be true the
Khaldeans were a very ancient people. One of the tablets shows that
King Memas was the principal author of the magnificent canal which
conducts the water of the river <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb13"
href="#pb13" name="pb13">13</a>]</span>Khoshab to the suburbs of Van,
and which is to-day called &ldquo;Shamiram-Su&rdquo; or river of
Semiramis.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e756src" href="#xd20e756" name=
"xd20e756src">11</a> The line of Vannic kings is traceable as far down
as 644 B.C.</p>
<p>Most of these inscriptions are to be found on a huge isolated rock,
situated in the curve of the bay, and known as the &ldquo;rock of
Van.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd20e761src" href="#xd20e761" name=
"xd20e761src">12</a> Among them are inscriptions left by Xerxes (485
B.C.), the Persian conqueror whose father&rsquo;s empire (Darius,
521&ndash;486 B.C.) succeeded the loose Scythian rule.</p>
<p>But the ancient Khaldean kingdom had already vanished when
Xerxes&rsquo; victorious army overran the country, for shortly after
the great influx of Scythians and the break-up of Assyria, came another
horde from the west, perhaps to fill up the void left by the Scythian
ravages. It is at this time that the Armenian people are first heard
from, and it is this horde, therefore, that is regarded as the
foundation stock of the Armenian people. They seem to have been an
Indo-European people residing in the territory north of the Black Sea,
for, coming from the west they must have entered Asia from Europe by
crossing the straits. The ancient Khaldeans were assimilated to some
extent, but for the most part, they were driven to the north and south,
where they have left traces that have been recognized and recorded by
Xenophon and Herodotus.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e766src" href=
"#xd20e766" name="xd20e766src">13</a></p>
<p>That the civilization and culture of the ancient Khaldeans were
utilized is beyond doubt. Their most ancient cities, Van, Armavir, were
foundations of Vannic kings, while recently it has been disclosed that
the city of Hajk, southeast of Van, shows some of the familiar features
of a Khaldean settlement. But their supreme god during the
pre-Christian era was not Khaldis, but the Persian Ormuzd, which
indicates that the Persians exercised an even greater influence.</p>
<p>How then could Semiramis ever have come to Van in quest of an
Armenian king, since it seems that the Scythians had already conquered
Assyria before the great influx of Armenian hordes? Nor does it seem
that the city of Van was built by the Assyrian queen, for the
inscriptions make no mention of her name. King Memas who, in the view
of Lynch, constructed the famous canal, was in all probability the
author of the garden city. The belief, according to Lynch, as already
stated, is that this legend is the Armenian version of the old Hellenic
myth of Aphrodite and Adonis, taken over during the domination of the
Seleucid dynasty which followed the conquest of Alexander about 325
B.C.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e774src" href="#xd20e774" name=
"xd20e774src">14</a></p>
<p>But this is unreasonable. That a myth should be taken over by a
subject people and the characters rechristened is not difficult to
understand, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb14" href="#pb14" name=
"pb14">14</a>]</span>but that the name of one of them should be applied
to the ancient city is very improbable to say the least. Furthermore,
the legend is flavored rather strongly with Persian voluptuousness, and
is not at all suggestive of Greek delicacy and refinement. Nor is the
fact that the horde overran the country after the destruction of
Assyria in any way conclusive, for if there were any assimilation at
all, as there must unquestionably have been, the Khaldean culture and
history was to that extent the actual possession of the Armenians. Even
intermarriage would perhaps be unnecessary, for what Irishman who has
been in the United States two months does not speak of Benjamin
Franklin and George Washington as his forefathers? It is to be noted
also that to this day the canal spoken of is called
&ldquo;Shamiram-Su&rdquo; or river of Semiramis, by all
Armenians.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e781src" href="#xd20e781" name=
"xd20e781src">15</a> On the whole it seems to me conclusive, therefore,
that the legend of Semiramis and Ara has its roots in Armenian history,
and is not at all a version of the Hellenic myth.</p>

<h3 class="main">Section 4. The Legend of Vahakn</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The legend of Vahakn, king and god of Armenians, is
very clearly attributable to the Greek period, which followed the
Persian conquest under Xerxes. Vahakn was deified because of his great
valor and made the fire-god of the Armenian people.<a class="noteref"
id="xd20e789src" href="#xd20e789" name="xd20e789src">16</a> He was
called &ldquo;Vishapakagh,&rdquo; uprooter of dragons, since he cleared
Armenia of monsters and saved it from evil influences. His exploits
were known in the abode of the gods as well as in Armenia. The most
famous of them was the theft of corn from the barns of King Barsham of
Assyria, from whom he ran away and tried to hide in heaven. Because of
the ears he dropped in his rapid flight, there arose the Milky Way
which is called in Armenian the &ldquo;track of the corn
stealer.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd20e792src" href="#xd20e792"
name="xd20e792src">17</a></p>
<p>Moses of Khorene writes as follows:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">Concerning the birth of this king the legends say,</p>
<div class="q">
<div class="body">
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line hangqq">&ldquo;Heaven and earth were in travail,</p>
<p class="line">And the crimson waters were in travail,</p>
<p class="line">And in the water, the crimson reed</p>
<p class="line">Was also in travail.</p>
<p class="line">From the mouth of the reed issued smoke,</p>
<p class="line">From the mouth of the reed issued flame,</p>
<p class="line">And out of the flame sprang the young child,</p>
<p class="line">His hair was of fire, a beard had he of flame,</p>
<p class="line">And his eyes were suns.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e822src" href="#xd20e822" name="xd20e822src">18</a></p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb15" href="#pb15" name=
"pb15">15</a>]</span></p>
<p>With our own ears did we hear these words sung to the accompaniment
of the harp. They sing moreover that he did fight with the dragons, and
overcame them; and some say that his valiant deeds were like unto
Hercules. Others declare that he was a god, and that a great image of
him stood in the land of Georgia, where it was worshipped, with
sacrifices.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e832src" href="#xd20e832" name=
"xd20e832src">19</a></p>
</div>
<p>The wife of Vahakn was Astghik, the goddess of beauty, a
personification of the moon, corresponding to the Phoenician and
Sidonian Astarte. This is suggestive of Greek influence, for Venus, the
Greek goddess of beauty, was also the wife of a fire-god,
Vulcan.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e840src" href="#xd20e840" name=
"xd20e840src">20</a></p>
<p>The flight of Vahakn before the Assyrian king is certainly more
suggestive of the fear in which the Assyrians must have been regarded
than of the valor of their god. The originators of the legend were good
psychologists, however, in regarding the instincts of fear and of
pugnacity as compatible. For even the slayer of demons must some day
face his superiors in strength, and when he does, will he not be
afraid? In fact he would be more afraid than another, for he could not
well impute more mercy to his superior than he himself had shown to his
inferiors.</p>
<p>The vein of humor is too rich to be left unnoted. If the Greeks
could laugh at their gods, and even mock them, the Armenians could also
make sport of them. For what could be more delightfully humorous than
the picture of a bearded god, a slayer of dragons, whose hair was of
flame and whose eyes like suns, stealing corn from the Assyrian king
and dropping the ears from his shoulders in his hasty flight across
heaven? The character thus brought out, together with the richness of
imaginative quality, especially in the song of his birth, the wholesome
and unveiled anthropomorphism (wholesome because it is unveiled), and
the correspondence between the Greek fire-god Vulcan whose wife was
Venus, the goddess of beauty, with the fire-god Vahakn whose wife
Astghik was also goddess of beauty, stamp the legend with its
unmistakable origin in Greek mythology.</p>

<h3 class="main">Section 5. The Historic Background of the Legend of
Vahakn</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Greek period from which this legend dates began
with the defeat of the Armenian king Vahy, who was overcome by
Alexander the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb16" href="#pb16" name=
"pb16">16</a>]</span>Great somewhere about 328 B.C.<a class="noteref"
id="xd20e854src" href="#xd20e854" name="xd20e854src">21</a> The Greeks
chose their own representative to rule over the province, who at the
time of Alexander&rsquo;s death was Seleucus. Historians have taken the
name of this governor to indicate the dynasty of Greek supremacy which
followed; i.e., the Seleucid dynasty. This method of the Greeks of
selecting their own man to govern a subject people, which was of course
in pursuance of their policy of superimposing their own culture upon
all subject nations, was contrary to the policy of the Parthians,
Romans, and Persians, who allowed the Armenians to maintain their
national independence provided they permitted the use of their armies
and duly paid their taxes. And it is this policy of the Greeks that
accounts for the fact that large portions of Greek mythology and
religion were taken over by the Armenians.</p>
<p>Although the period of political supremacy was short-lived, the
influence of Greek culture continued to permeate the social life of the
people through the reign of the Arsacid kings.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e862src" href="#xd20e862" name="xd20e862src">22</a> In 246 B.C.
Arsaces, a Parthian, made himself master of the Parthians, Persians,
Medes, Babylonians, and lastly Armenians.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e868src" href="#xd20e868" name="xd20e868src">23</a> His grandson,
Arsaces the Great, conquered as far as India, and after seating himself
securely upon the throne of Persia, placed his brother Valarsace upon
the Armenian throne, so founding the Persian and Armenian Arsacid
dynasties (150 B.C.).<a class="noteref" id="xd20e874src" href=
"#xd20e874" name="xd20e874src">24</a> The Persian Arsacidae became
extinct in A.D. 226 when they were overthrown by the Persian Sasanidae,
whereas the Armenian Arsacidae line continued up until A.D. 428, when
the Armenian kingdom was divided between Persia and Rome by Shapuh, the
Persian monarch, and Theodosius II.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e878src"
href="#xd20e878" name="xd20e878src">25</a> This makes a period of 578
years (150 B.C.-A.D. 428) during which Armenia was governed by her own
line of kings, and enjoyed the liberties of national independence. To
be sure after the conquest of Lucullus and Pompey (66 B.C.) Armenia
became tributary to Rome, but the right of succession remained with the
Armenian royal family, even during Roman supremacy, so that the
national life was in no manner interfered with.<a class="noteref" id=

capital, Tigranacerta, with a court of matchless splendor.<a class=

He is spoken of by historians as a king of kings, and as having ruled
with a pomp, splendor, and pride never before known. Defeated by Pompey

<h3 class="main">Section 6. The Period of National Integration</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The continuity of the period of the Armenian Arsacidae
makes it the time when the process of national solidification and
unification was carried out to the point that made Armenia a nation,
and beyond this point. Raffi asserts that the introduction of Greek
culture during the Arsacid dynasty not only changed the religion of
Armenians, but also so affected their language and customs that they
became different from the Persians, which is proof that a process of
social readjustment was going on.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e903src"
href="#xd20e903" name="xd20e903src">28</a> It was during this period
that the wandering minstrels spoken of by Langlois journeyed from one
end of the nation to the other, singing their songs, repeating the
national legends, relating the news of the world and the court gossip
which probably made up the largest portion of it.</p>
<div lang="fr" class="blockquote">
<p class="first">Les chants de l&rsquo;antique Arm&eacute;nie
rappellent principalement des &eacute;v&eacute;nements la plupart
h&eacute;roiques et l&eacute;gendaires, accomplis &agrave; des
&eacute;poques tr&egrave;s diff&eacute;rentes, ce qui donne &agrave;
penser qu&rsquo;ils ont d&ucirc; &ecirc;tre compos&eacute;s &agrave;

en face des autels. Au contraire, on reconnait de prime abord que ces
chants sont l&rsquo;oeuvre de bardes nationaux, ayant un libre acces
dans les palais des souverains et &agrave; la cour des satrapes.
C&rsquo;est ce qui fait supposer que ces po&egrave;mes sont
peut&ecirc;tre d&ucirc;s &agrave; des m&eacute;nestrels, &agrave; la

c&eacute;l&eacute;brer leurs vertus et leurs prouesses.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd20e909src" href="#xd20e909" name=
"xd20e909src">29</a></p>
</div>
<p>This is putting the case conservatively, for Moses speaks often of
&ldquo;<span lang="fr">les chantres</span>&rdquo; and
&ldquo;<span lang="fr">les chants</span>.&rdquo; They traveled as far
as Persia and returned, for it is related by the Italian Countess
Evelyn Martinengo how a wandering minstrel, who had just returned from
that country, was entertained by an Armenian patriarchal family living
in the kind of underground <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb18" href=
"#pb18" name="pb18">18</a>]</span>habitation described in the beginning
of this thesis.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e925src" href="#xd20e925"
name="xd20e925src">30</a> No one was ever more welcome than the
minstrel. He was assigned to the guest chamber usually prepared
especially for him, and always the best chamber in the household. His
head and feet were washed for him by the wife of the patriarch, and at
meal time all the delicacies of the household were spread before him.
All guests were welcome, but no guest more welcome than the minstrel.
They must have listened to his tales in a kind of petrified awe, and
heard him sing his songs in speechless enjoyment.</p>
<p>It was a practice among the minstrels of the time to compete with
each other in public, and it is related how two minstrels entertained
by a Persian prince were led out upon an open grass plot and seated,
one facing the other. Five thousand people made a circle around the
competitors while the rivals contended in song and verse, riddle and
repartee. Each began where the other left off, until finally one failed
to perceive the drift of his adversary, and answering at random, the
spectators proclaimed him beaten. The triumphant bard was led to the
vanquished, whose lyre was taken from him and broken. Robed in a
prince&rsquo;s mantle, the victor was taken to the highest seat in the
banquet hall.</p>
<p>That the people were the judges of the contest, indicates how well
they must have been acquainted with the current folk-songs, legends,
and tradition. How generally and frequently the custom of minstrel
competition was practiced throughout Armenia is not known, but it
certainly is proof, besides Moses&rsquo; own statements to the same
effect, that the national legends and folk-songs were the possession of
the common people. And what is more important, this same body of
legends, folk-songs, and tradition did more than any other one thing to
weld the sentiments of the people into a single national sentiment,
which crystallized into a real patriotism, a real loyalty and devotion
to any cause that was a national cause, because it was the natural,
spontaneous expression of the life and thought of the people, and no
mean, artificial thing superimposed from outside.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e935src" href="#xd20e935" name="xd20e935src">31</a></p>
<p>There are other reasons for giving this period the social importance
that I have ascribed to it. The conversion of the people to
Christianity about the third century after Christ was achieved in no
sentimental fashion, but, as I believe, in a manner in which it alone
could have been done, namely, at the point of the sword of their own
king, Tiridates, who was converted from paganism to Christianity by
Gregory the Illuminator. The traditions in connection with this
important event will be told later. Suffice it to say at this point
that the whole process of conversion was carried out so thoroughly and
completely, that it may be described as a national volte-face, and
therefore did not result in the disintegration, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb19" href="#pb19" name="pb19">19</a>]</span>civil
strife, and social chaos that would unquestionably have been the result
had the process been carried out by means of peaceful penetration and
propaganda.</p>
<p>The third and last argument in support of the social and national
importance of the period of the Arsacid kings is in respect to the
alphabet which was compiled by St. Mesrob Maschtotz. St. Mesrob was a
former secretary of the king, and desired to extirpate the last
remnants of paganism in the province of Akoulis, but in the absence of
an alphabet he was unable to carry out any scheme of propaganda. He
therefore besought the king, Vramschapouh, to put an end to this state
of things and the latter, in response to the request, placed all
available material at the disposal of the saint. The task was
accomplished in 404, somewhat at the expense of the future devotees of
the language, for the alphabet contains thirty-eight letters.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd20e944src" href="#xd20e944" name="xd20e944src">32</a>
Nevertheless, most of the sounds of foreign languages were represented,
making it particularly useful as a foundation language for other
languages. St. Mesrob, with a body of translators trained by himself
and St. Sahak, then proceeded to the translation of the Bible, which
was not completed until 433. Liturgies and song-books quickly followed.
To be sure the effect of the invention of the alphabet and the
distribution of the various religious publications that followed were
not felt during the period of the Arsacidae, for the Bible was not
published until after the break-up of the kingdom in 428, when it was
divided between Persia and Rome. But the important point is that the
time had come when the need for an alphabet was making itself very
strongly felt, and this could not have been true of a diversified,
heterogeneous population.</p>
<p>For the three reasons above mentioned, i.e., first, the work of
minstrels, second, the Christianizing of the nation, and third, the
invention of the alphabet, all occurring during the successive reigns
of the Arsacid kings, I should ascribe to this period (150 B.C.-A.D.

as a terrible shock, necessitating a complete social readjustment, but
the fact that the readjustment was made shows that the people were
ready for it. For better or for worse the yoke of Christianity was
fastened to the neck of the people, and with it they had to

for the Armenian church has been the chief power during the last ten or
fifteen centuries in keeping alive the streams of national life, and in
holding the people together in the face of invasion and repeated
attempts at proselytization by the Persians and by the Greek and Roman
Catholic churches.</p>

<h3 class="main">Section 7. Legends of Artasches and Artavasd</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The legends of Artasches and Satenik, and of Artavasd,
the son of Artasches, belong to the Arsacid period, for Artavasd and
Artasches are Armenian kings of the Arsacid dynasty, according to
Moses.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e965src" href="#xd20e965" name=
"xd20e965src">34</a> The Alans who, according to the legend, were a
neighboring people residing in the mountain region in the vicinity of
Georgia, spread themselves over Armenia while Artasches, the Armenian
king, collected a great army and forced the Alans to retreat across the
river Kur where they pitched camp. The son of the Alan king was taken
captive and brought to Artasches, which forced the former to seek peace
on whatever terms the Armenian king might wish, provided only his son
was returned in safety. But Artasches refused, whereupon the sister of
the captured boy came to the river bank, and standing upon a great rock
spoke to the camp of Artasches by means of interpreters saying:
&ldquo;Oh brave Artasches, who hast vanquished the great nation of
Alans, unto thee I speak. Come, hearken unto the bright-eyed daughter
of the Alan king and give back the youth. For it is not the way of
heroes to destroy life at the root, nor for the sake of humbling and
enslaving a hostage to establish everlasting enmity between two great
nations.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd20e968src" href="#xd20e968"
name="xd20e968src">35</a> Artasches, having heard of these sayings went
to the river bank and having seen that the girl was beautiful, and
listened to her words of wisdom, wished to marry her. His chamberlain
considered it a wise stroke of policy, and therefore went to the Alan
king, soliciting the hand of the princess for his master, whose oaths
and assurances of peace he vouched for, together with the promise to
return the boy. The king of the Alans answered, &ldquo;From whence
shall brave Artasches give thousands upon thousands, and ten thousands
upon tens of thousands in return for the maiden?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Writes Moses:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">Concerning this, the poets of that land sing in their
songs:</p>
<div class="q">
<div class="body">
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line hangqq">&ldquo;Brave King Artasches</p>
<p class="line">Mounted his fine black charger,</p>
<p class="line">And took the red leathern cord</p>
<p class="line">With the golden ring.</p>
<p class="line">Like a swift winged eagle</p>
<p class="line">He passed over the river</p>
<p class="line">And cast the golden ring</p>
<p class="line">Round the waist of the Alan Princess; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb21" href="#pb21" name="pb21">21</a>]</span></p>
<p class="line">Causing much pain to the tender maiden</p>
<p class="line">As he bore her swiftly back to his camp.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Which being interpreted meaneth that he was commanded to give much
gold, leather, and crimson dye in exchange for the maiden. So also they
sing of the wedding:</p>
<div class="q">
<div class="body">
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line hangqq">&ldquo;It rained showers of gold when Artasches
became a bridegroom,</p>
<p class="line">It rained pearls when Satenik became a
bride.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>For it was the custom of our kings to scatter coins amongst the
people when they arrived at the doors of the temple for their wedding,
as also for the queens to scatter pearls in their
bride-chamber.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e1017src" href="#xd20e1017"
name="xd20e1017src">36</a></p>
</div>
<p>The couplet quoted is still sung by the Armenians, and it is still
customary for the bridegroom to scatter money on his way to the church,
and though it may be for queens to scatter pearls, the Armenian bride
is not to be outdone. She is given a partly opened pomegranate which
she throws at the door of the bridegroom upon the arrival at the
bridegroom&rsquo;s home after the ceremony at the church, the bits of
pomegranate scattering themselves about as pearls.</p>
<p>After fifty-one years of a very prosperous reign, Artasches, who was
very much beloved by his people, died. The funeral procession was a
most magnificent one, and many of the people killed themselves, out of
love for their dead king, according to the custom of the time. And when
the body was laid in the grave they threw precious jewels, gold, and
silver after it. Nor did the lamenting and suicide stop after his
burial, for upon the grave of their dead king the nobles and the people
continued to kill themselves. So great was the slaughter that Artavasd,
son of Artasches, and king after his father&rsquo;s death, addressed
the spirit of his dead father, saying, &ldquo;Behold, thou art taking
all with thee; dost thou leave me to rule over ruins and the
dead?&rdquo; The words given by Moses of Khorene are: &ldquo;Now that
thou art gone, and hast taken with thee the whole land, how shall I
reign over the ruins?&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd20e1043src" href=
"#xd20e1043" name="xd20e1043src">37</a> Whereupon the spirit of
Artasches cursed him and said,</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line hangqq">&ldquo;When thou ridest forth to hunt</p>
<p class="line">Over the free heights of Ararat,</p>
<p class="line">The strong ones shall have thee,</p>
<p class="line">And shall take thee up</p>
<p class="line">On to the free heights of Ararat.</p>
<p class="line">There shalt thou abide,</p>
<p class="line">And never more see the light.&rdquo;<a class="noteref"

</div>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb22" href="#pb22" name=

<p>These words together with those of Artavasd spoken to his
father&rsquo;s spirit were sung by the singers of the time.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd20e1066src" href="#xd20e1066" name=
"xd20e1066src">39</a></p>
<p>One day while out hunting Artavasd was seized by some visionary
terror and lost his reason. Urging his horse down a steep bank he fell
into a chasm where he sank and disappeared. Old women told how he was
confined in a cavern and bound with iron chains which his two dogs
gnawed at daily in order to set him free. But somehow at the sound of
the hammers striking on the anvils, the chains were continually
strengthened, and it was customary among the blacksmiths of the time to
strike the anvil three or four times to strengthen, as they said, the
chains of Artavasd. And so the tradition was kept up by singers and
blacksmiths; the blacksmiths and old women having consigned the jealous
king to the world&rsquo;s nethermost regions, while the singers left
him to the solitude of Ararat in accordance with the curse of
Artasches.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Section 8. Conclusions</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Such are the ancient legends of Armenia, in their
respective historical settings: the legends of Haic, of Semiramis and
Ara, of Vahakn, of Artasches and Satenik, and of Artavasd. All of them
antedate the Christian era, and some of them by many centuries. Each
one of them is told by Moses of Khorene. But as to origin and probable
historic roots Moses was silent, for he was writing a history. He
constantly laments the absolute dearth of material and sources and
begins his accounts of these legends with the words &ldquo;This is as
it is told,&rdquo; or &ldquo;the singers say,&rdquo; indicating that
his only sources for them were the songs and reports current among the
people during his own time. The legends of Haic and of Semiramis and
Ara are told by Moses as though he believed them historic fact, but of
course Moses had no materials to serve as a basis of criticism. He is
careful to quote Mar Apas Catina as his only source for this material.
The other three legends are regarded as such. Artavasd is spoken of as
an historical king who lost his reason while riding horseback and fell
into a deep chasm. The practice of suicide at the death of Artasches,
his father, was a pagan custom. The curse of the spirit of the dead
father, the chains, the dogs, and the anvils were of course recognized
as the work of ingenious fancy. In view therefore, of the questionable
character of Moses&rsquo; sources these legends have very little
historic value. They do, however, have a high social value inasmuch as
the common knowledge of them among the people was the only ultimate
source at the disposal of the historian.</p>
<p>The second conclusion is that these legends formed a very important
part of the larger mass of tradition and songs that served to cement
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb23" href="#pb23" name=
"pb23">23</a>]</span>the people into a nation. Just how important, it
would be difficult to say, but the fact that they were current at the
time Moses wrote indicates that they were current and passed on from
generation to generation during the whole period of the Arsacidae
kings. And as the people had no alphabet during this whole period, they
must have been passed on by song and word of mouth. This was a time of
special activity on the part of the minstrels and singers, and
therefore the development of the national consciousness characteristic
of the period must have been brought about in a large measure through
the medium of these legendary beliefs.</p>
<p>Furthermore these legends are known by the Armenian people to-day
and are taught in the schools that are not too severely under the rules
of Turkish and Russian censorship. Naturally enough, they are a source
of great pride since they breathe national independence and loyalty.
But of course, the Turks and Russians have suppressed all public
singing of songs, and public teaching of history and legend that may
possibly be construed as partaking of the national spirit.</p>
<p>It may be argued that these legends slumbered between the covers of
Moses&rsquo; history during the centuries known as the dark ages, and
that they had no social value until the contagion of the European
spirit of the Renaissance awoke the legends and the people at the same
time. But the mere dearth of record is no proof of this Rip Van Winkle
theory. There is at least one reliable authority sufficient to disprove
it, viz., Grigor Magistros, a scholar of the eleventh century who wrote
that he heard the Artasches epic sung by minstrels.<a class="noteref"
id="xd20e1084src" href="#xd20e1084" name="xd20e1084src">40</a> Besides
the unreasonableness of the supposition, there is the added fact of an
independent Armenian kingdom known as the Bagradouni dynasty, whose
capital seat was at the famous city of Ani. This kingdom included
greater Armenia and continued from A.D. 887 to 1079.<a class="noteref"
id="xd20e1087src" href="#xd20e1087" name="xd20e1087src">41</a> But 1079
does not mark the end of Armenian independence though it marks the
destruction of Ani, for Reuben, a member of the royal family, made his
way into Cilicia in the year 1080, and rallying a handful of Armenians
about him, overpowered the Greeks and founded what is known as the
Rupenian Kingdom of Cilicia, which continued during a period of 300
years. So that here again is a period of very nearly five hundred years
(889&ndash;1380), during which time the Armenian people enjoyed
national political independence.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e1090src"
href="#xd20e1090" name="xd20e1090src">42</a> And this during the very
period of the dark ages, about which we know so little! We could not,
therefore, for a moment suppose the traditions and legends to have had
no social importance during these centuries, for such an assumption
would be in flat contradiction to the witness of Grigor Magistros, and
to the facts of Armenian history. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb24"

<p class="footnote">The first Arsacidae king of Armenia, Valarsace,
whose reign began in 149 B.C. found the kingdom in general disorder and
was the first to organize the country along national lines. As a
Parthian he was unacquainted with the history and institutions of the
people, and desiring to build upon the established foundation, such as
it was, he sent a Syrian scholar, Mar Apas Catina by name, with a
letter to his brother, Arsace, king of Persia, requesting the latter to
allow the Syrian access to the royal archives with the view of finding
a history of Armenia. Mar Apas Catina found an old MS containing a
history of ancient Armenia which bore the name of no author, and which
was translated from Chaldean to Greek by order of Alexander the Great.
It was translated into Syriac by the Syrian scholar for the benefit of
Valarsace, but the MS has been lost, and there is not the slightest
trace of it anywhere. It must have been in existence however, during
the fifth century after Christ for Moses of Khorene used it as his only
source for Armenia&rsquo;s ancient history, in writing his general
history of Armenia. The old MS being lost, the translation by Mar Apas
Catina and the first part of the history of Moses are given as
identical to each other in Langlois&rsquo; collection of Armenian
historians. The ancient history contains the legends of Haic, of Ara
and Semiramis, and of Vahakn, some of the songs of heroes, still sung,
and other matter which is strictly speaking not historical. As a
history, therefore, it is unreliable and unauthentic, but from the
standpoint of the social historian it is invaluable, for a belief is as
important a fact to sociology as the dethronement of a king is to
history.</p>

<p class="footnote">Moses of Khorene, called the Herodotus of Armenia,
has written the best known history of the Armenian people. The work has
been translated into Latin, Italian, French, German, and Russian. Moses
lived in the fifth century, two centuries after the conversion of the
nation to Christianity. He belonged to the second order of translators
in the school of St. Sahag and St. Mesrob, and was sent to Syria,
Egypt, Greece, and Rome in order to complete his studies. Upon
returning to his country he found everything in disorder. St. Sahag and
St. Mesrob were dead, the king had been overthrown, and he chose the
life of solitude. Sometime later he was chosen bishop and requested by
an Armenian prince, Sahag Bagratide, to write a history of his country,
which task he took up with great enthusiasm. The translation of Mar
Apas Catina was his only source for Armenian ancient history. He
carefully differentiates hearsay from fact, never fails to stamp a
fable or legend as such, and generally quotes his authorities where he
has them. Considering the limitation of his materials, and the time in
which he wrote, Moses wrote a really remarkable book, although the
verdicts of a few critics have been unfavorable.</p>

influence of Greek culture is chiefly indicated by the fact that the
pagan divinities were Greek and that many temples were erected to these
gods and goddesses all over the country. (Agathange, <i lang=
"fr">Histoire du R&egrave;gne de Tiridate</i>. Langlois
1:164&ndash;70.) Secondly, there were formed by St. Sahag and St.
Mesrob in the fifth century after the conversion of the nation to
Christianity, schools of translators, who studied in Greece, Egypt, and
Rome and whose chief works were translations from the Greek. With the
conversion (301) came the necessity for a written language, the
characters of which were invented by St. Mesrob in 404. Thereupon were
organized the schools of translators whose chief study of necessity was
Greek, and whose translations and original works have given to the
fifth century the title of &ldquo;Golden Age of Armenian
Literature.&rdquo; (Langlois 1:xxi&ndash;xxvi, 2:vii.)</p>

Langlois 1:ix, x. These songs of which Moses of Khorene very frequently
speaks are classified by Langlois into songs of the first order, the
second order, and the third order. The first are relative to the
prowess of Armenian kings and gods; the second concern a long series of
military exploits accomplished against the Assyrians, Medes, and
Persians; the third refer especially to traditions in connection with
the Assyrians. The birth-song of Vahakn is an illustration of the songs
of the first order (p. x, xi). Flint in his <i>History of the
Philosophy of History</i>, p. 42, speaks of this period of minstrelsy
as necessarily preceding the use of letters everywhere. &ldquo;The myth
and legend interest primitive man more than real fact. His vision is
more largely of the imagination than of the sense of judgment. It is an
error to regard the rude minstrelsy which generally preceded the use of
letters as essentially historical.&rdquo;</p>

further proofs that may be cited. The history of English and French
literature shows that the golden age of their literature followed a
period of social integration along national lines. And it is true that
the golden age of Armenian literature dawned with the closing decades
of the Arsacidae dynasty, and continued several decades beyond. And
finally, when Valarsace, the first Arsacidae, ascended the throne of
Armenia, finding everything in a state of disorder, he organized the
country along national lines. Dividing the kingdom into provinces he
placed his governors at the heads of them; he organized a standing
army, appointed guardians of the granaries, established courts of
justice, a royal guard, and minutely regulated court life. What is most
interesting is that he appointed two reporters, one to remind him in
his anger, &ldquo;<span lang="fr">le bien &agrave; faire</span>,&rdquo;
the other to remind him of the necessity for doing justice.

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Section 1. Pre-Christian Mythology and Religion</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The second body of legends which I wish to consider is
chiefly concerned with the introduction of Christianity into the
country. These, together with the traditional beliefs centered about
the chief geographical feature of the land, Mt. Ararat, constitute a
group bearing a very distinct religious stamp. For this reason, and
also because they have a later origin, they are to be marked off very
distinctly from those already taken up. In view of their religious
bearing I shall introduce them with a brief account of the various
forms of pagan worship that preceded the Christianization of the
people.</p>
<p>The chief religious influences have been the Assyrian, the Persian,
and the Greek. It seems, however, that a kind of monotheism prevailed
before the gods of any of these were taken over. The very ancient
Armenian kings planted groves of poplars around their cities and the
worship was carried on in these groves.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e1107src" href="#xd20e1107" name="xd20e1107src">1</a> An altar was
placed among the trees, where the first male descendant of the royal
family (and perhaps other families) offered sacrifices to the one God,
while the priests derived oracles from the rustling of the leaves. Even
now the poplar groves are held in uncommon regard. This is a survival
of the old belief that they were the dwelling place of God, and of the
later practice of consecrating children in them. The belief that God
dwelt among the leaves must have been suggested by the slightest
trembling of the leaves, even at the gentlest breeze, and one can well
imagine the people looking up at them in the impressive silence of the
forest with an awe and wonder no other environment could possibly
induce. The Armenian for poplar, &ldquo;Sossi&rdquo; is used to-day as
a name for girls, and the poplar tree, although not held sacred by
Armenian people to-day, is certainly regarded with great
reverence.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e1113src" href="#xd20e1113" name=
"xd20e1113src">2</a></p>
<p>The influence of Persian worship is more clear. Aramazd, the
architect of the universe, lord and creator of all things, was the
chief <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb25" href="#pb25" name=
"pb25">25</a>]</span>Armenian god, and is unquestionably the Persian
Ormuzd named in the inscription of Xerxes on the rock of Van. Armenians
have given him the title of &ldquo;father of the gods,&rdquo; and the
qualifications &ldquo;great, and strong, creator of heaven and earth,
and god of fertility and of abundance.&rdquo; The Greeks identified him
with Zeus.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e1123src" href="#xd20e1123" name=
"xd20e1123src">3</a> There were numerous sanctuaries erected in his
honor, and at the annual festival celebrated in his name, white
animals, especially goats, horses, and mules, were sacrificed and their
blood used to fill silver and golden goblets.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e1129src" href="#xd20e1129" name="xd20e1129src">4</a> Tir, or
&ldquo;Grogh&rdquo; meaning in Armenian &ldquo;to write&rdquo; was his
attendant spirit, whose chief business it was to watch over mankind,
recording their good and evil deeds.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e1135src" href="#xd20e1135" name="xd20e1135src">5</a> Upon the
death of a person &ldquo;Grogh&rdquo; conducted the soul of the
departed before his master, who opened the great book, and balancing
the good and evil deeds, assigned a reward or punishment. Grogh is also
the personification of hope and fear, and the expression &ldquo;may
Grogh take you&rdquo; is still very commonly used among the people,
especially by servant girls and those whose language has not undergone
the purification of a season of &ldquo;<span lang="de">Sturm und
Drang.</span>&rdquo; It is interesting to note that this and some other
expressions owe their survival to usage among women rather than among
men, which is not difficult of explanation when one considers the
social restrictions that women are generally subject to.
&ldquo;<span lang="de">Viele Seiten des alten heidnischen Glaubens sind
in dem heutigen Volksglauben, besonders bei den tiefer stehenden
Volksschichten, bei alten Bauerinnen, als &uuml;berbleibsel der
Vergangenheit erhalten.</span>&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e1145src" href="#xd20e1145" name="xd20e1145src">6</a></p>
<p>The god Mihr represented fire, and was the son of Aramazd.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd20e1150src" href="#xd20e1150" name="xd20e1150src">7</a>
He guided heroes in battle, and was commemorated by a festival held in
the beginning of spring. Fires were kindled in the open market place in
his honor, and a lantern lit from one of these fires was kept burning
in his temple throughout the year.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e1156src"
href="#xd20e1156" name="xd20e1156src">8</a> It is still a festival
among the people, although it has a different significance, and will be
described more in detail later on. This is practiced not only by the
Armenians, but also by the Syrian Maronites who reside in the Lebanon.
I have seen the mountainsides literally aglow with a thousand fires in
celebration of a Christian festival that has its roots in the pagan
ceremony in honor of Mihr. The practice of a continually burning
lantern was also carried over by some branches of the Christian church.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb26" href="#pb26" name=
"pb26">26</a>]</span></p>
<p>Both Persians and Armenians were worshippers of Mihr (fire-worship),
although there was a very distinct difference between the two. The
Armenian sacred fire was invisible, whereas the Persian was material
and kept up throughout the whole year. It is for this reason that the
Armenians called the Persians fire-worshippers. The only visible
fire-god worshipped by the Armenians was the sun, to which temples were
dedicated, and after which the Armenian calendar month
&ldquo;Areg&rdquo; was named.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e1171src" href=
"#xd20e1171" name="xd20e1171src">9</a> The &ldquo;Children of the
Sun&rdquo; as they were called, offered the most persistent opposition
to the introduction of Christianity, and a community of them continued
their worship in the face of persecution after Christianity became the
religion of the state. The phrase &ldquo;let me die for your
sun,&rdquo; and the oath &ldquo;let the sun of my son be
witness,&rdquo; are language survivals of this particular worship.</p>
<p>The Greek worship, introduced first during the Seleucid dynasty, and
emphasized and encouraged by the line of Arsacidae kings up to the
introduction of Christianity, exercised an even stronger influence than
the Persian. Many of the Greek divinities were rechristened and adopted
by the people. Chief of these was Anahit, &ldquo;Mother of
Chastity,&rdquo; known also as the &ldquo;Pure and Spotless
Goddess,&rdquo; who was the daughter of Aramazd, and corresponded to
the Greek Artemid and the Roman Diana.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e1176src" href="#xd20e1176" name="xd20e1176src">10</a> She was
also regarded as the benefactress of the people. Writes Agathangelus:
&ldquo;Through her (Anahit) the Armenian land exists; from her it draws
its life, she is the glory of our nation and its
protectress.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd20e1179src" href=
"#xd20e1179" name="xd20e1179src">11</a> Images and shrines were
dedicated to her name under the titles, &ldquo;The Golden
Mother,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Being of Golden Birth.&rdquo; A summer
festival was celebrated in her honor at which a dove and a rose were
offered to her golden image. The day was called &ldquo;Vartavar,&rdquo;
meaning &ldquo;the flaming of the rose.&rdquo; The temples of Anahit
and the golden image were destroyed with the conversion of the people
to Christianity, but the festival has continued as a regular church
festival under the same name &ldquo;Vartavar&rdquo; though of course
with a different meaning.</p>
<p>The second and third daughters of Aramazd were Astghik, the goddess
of beauty, and Nane, or Noone, the goddess of contrivance.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd20e1184src" href="#xd20e1184" name=
"xd20e1184src">12</a> The former was the wife of Vahakn, the mythical
king-god, the legend in respect to whom has been told, and corresponded
to the Phoenician and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb27" href="#pb27"
name="pb27">27</a>]</span>Sidonian Astarte. It is stated by Raffi that
the goddess of contrivance was a necessary power to womankind, for then
as now woman had to make big things out of small. Sandaramet, the wife
of Aramazd, was an invisible goddess and personification of the earth.
Her master sent rain upon her, and brought forth vegetation. Later she
became the synonym for Hades. Perhaps the best summary of Armenian
worship as existing before the Christian time is that given by St.
Martin.</p>

<h3 class="main">Section 2. Legends of Abgar, Thaddeus, and St.
Bartholomew</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The first connection that Armenians had with
Christianity occurred in the reign of King Abgar, whose capital was at
Edessa (now Ourfa) during the time of Christ&rsquo;s teaching in
Palestine.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e1209src" href="#xd20e1209" name=
"xd20e1209src">15</a> The story is legendary and very popular. Abgar
was called a great man because of his exceeding meekness and wisdom. As
the result of several severe military campaigns, the health of the king
began to give way. This led to complications which developed into a
very painful disease. It was at this time that Abgar sent two of his
messengers to the Roman governor, Marinus, to show the Roman a treaty
of peace that had been made between Ardasches and his brother of
Persia, who had quarreled and had been reconciled by their kinsman
Abgar; for the Romans suspected that Abgar had gone to Persia in order
to collect and direct a Persian-Armenian army against the
Romans.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e1212src" href="#xd20e1212" name=
"xd20e1212src">16</a> To clear himself of all suspicion, therefore,
those two messengers were sent to show the treaty of peace to the Roman
governor. On their return the messengers went up to Jerusalem in order
to see Christ, having heard of his wonderful deeds. And when they
returned to their king, Abgar, they told of the works of Christ, at
which the king marveled, and believed him to be the very Son of God.
The king, because of his sickness, sent Christ <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb28" href="#pb28" name="pb28">28</a>]</span>a letter
asking him to come and heal him of his disease. The letter is quoted as
follows:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">The letter of Abgarus to our Saviour Jesus Christ.
&ldquo;Abgarus, a prince of the world, unto Jesus the Saviour and
Benefactor, who hast appeared in the City of Jerusalem, Greetings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have heard of thee, and of the healings wrought by thy
hands, without drugs and without roots; for it is said that thou givest
sight to the blind, thou makest the lame to walk, and thou cleanest the
lepers; thou curest those who have been long tormented by diseases, and
raisest even the dead. And when I heard all this concerning thee, I
thought that either thou art God come down from heaven that workest
these things, or the Son of God. I have written unto thee, that thou
shouldst trouble thyself to come unto me, and heal me of my disease. I
have heard also that the Jews murmur against thee, and think to torture
thee. My city is a small one, but it is beautiful, and it is sufficient
for us twain.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd20e1222src" href=
"#xd20e1222" name="xd20e1222src">17</a></p>
</div>
<p>The messengers delivered the message to Jesus in Jerusalem, to which
the gospel bears witness in the words, &ldquo;There were some amongst
the heathen that came up to him.&rdquo; But Jesus could do no more than
to send a letter in reply.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">The answer to the letter of Abgarus, written at the
command of our Saviour by the Apostle Thomas: &ldquo;Blessed is he who
believeth on me, though he hath not seen me. For it is written
concerning me thus: &lsquo;they that have seen me believed not on me,
but they that have not seen me shall believe and live.&rsquo; And
concerning that which thou hast written unto me to come down unto thee,
it is needful that I fulfill all that for which I was sent; and when I
have fulfilled it I will ascend unto Him that sent me. And after my
ascension I will send one of my disciples, who shall heal thee of thy
disease, and give life unto thee and unto all that are with
thee.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd20e1230src" href="#xd20e1230"
name="xd20e1230src">18</a></p>
</div>
<p>This letter was duly delivered to Abgar, with the image of the
Saviour, which was still kept in Edessa at the time of Moses&rsquo;
writing. The legend concerning the image is somewhat as follows. One of
the three messengers sent to Jesus with the letter of Abgar was an
artist who was told to paint a portrait of Jesus in case the latter
found it impossible to take the journey. The artist tried in vain to
paint a good picture, and having noticed him, Jesus took a handkerchief
and passing it over his face a most exact likeness was stamped upon it,
which he gave to the artist to be given to the king.</p>
<p>The quaint ending of Abgar&rsquo;s letter is worth the whole legend.
What could be simpler or more seductive than the invitation, &ldquo;My
city is a small one, but it is beautiful, and it is sufficient for us
twain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tradition of the Armenian church, or the Gregorian church, as it
is more commonly called, acknowledges St. Thaddeus and St. Bartholomew
as the original founders, who are therefore designated as the first
illuminators of Armenia.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e1240src" href=
"#xd20e1240" name="xd20e1240src">19</a> Concerning the recognition of
the tradition <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb29" href="#pb29" name=
"pb29">29</a>]</span>of St. Bartholomew, which includes his apostolic
journeys, his preaching, and his martyrdom in Armenia, all Christian
churches are unanimous. The name Albanus given as the place of his
martyrdom, is the same as the name Albacus, hallowed by the Armenian
tradition. His mission covered a period of sixteen years (A.D.
44&ndash;60). There is difference of opinion, however, in regard to the
dates.</p>
<p>The traditions about St. Thaddeus vary. Some suppose him to have
been the brother of St. Thomas, and according to these, he traveled to
Ardaze by way of Edessa. There is an anachronism, however, in this
tradition which would transfer the mission of Thaddeus to the second
century. According to a second tradition he is not the brother of
Thomas, but one St. Judas Thaddeus, surnamed Lebbeus, who also is said
to have established a sanctuary of worship at Ardaze, a circumstance
admitted by the Greek and Latin churches. The Armenian church places
the time of this mission as a period of eight years from 35&ndash;43.
That this has been done to lay a strong foundation for the claim of
apostolic origin may be suspected, especially in view of the belief
that apostolic origin is essential to every Christian church, in order,
as stated by Ormanian, &ldquo;to place her in union with her Divine
Founder.&rdquo; The church, however, has us at its mercy, for
conclusive evidence one way or another is lacking. Nevertheless, the
fact of Thaddeus&rsquo; mission to Armenia wherever and whenever it
might have occurred, is undisputed.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e1247src"
href="#xd20e1247" name="xd20e1247src">20</a></p>
<p>The matter is not especially important except to theologians with
their doctrines of &ldquo;apostolic origins.&rdquo; What is perfectly
clear is that both these men did their work in comparative silence, and
that they did not make very much headway, for if they had there would
have been less doubt concerning the traditions. The great work was done
by King Tiridates, and Gregory, who converted him about A.D. 301. The
traditions concerning these men are among the most cherished
possessions of the Armenian church.</p>

<h3 class="main">Section 3. Legends of Rhipsime and Gregory</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">These traditions have their historical setting in the
reign of Tiridates, and of Chosroes the father of Tiridates.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd20e1260src" href="#xd20e1260" name=
"xd20e1260src">21</a> Just as there was an Arsacid dynasty in Armenia,
dating and originating in the Parthian conquests and supremacy, so also
was there an Arsacid dynasty of Persia. The Persian king at the time of
Chosroes was a kinsman of the latter, called <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb30" href="#pb30" name="pb30">30</a>]</span>Ardavan,
who was overthrown (A.D. 227) by a Persian prince of the province of
Fars, named Ardashir.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e1265src" href=
"#xd20e1265" name="xd20e1265src">22</a> His dynasty, a very powerful
one, known as the Sassanid dynasty, supplanted the Arsacid dynasty of
Persia. Chosroes of Armenia, fearing future difficulty with the new
Persian monarch, ardently supported his dethroned kinsman. The next
year (228), therefore, he led a huge army beyond the frontiers of
Persia, and laid waste her provinces to the gates of
Ctesiphon.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e1268src" href="#xd20e1268" name=
"xd20e1268src">23</a> The war was continued for ten years, during which
time the Armenian capital, Vagharshapat, was filled with the booty of
successful raids. The reigning Caesar, Severus, also alarmed by the
success of the new Persian king, headed a Roman army against Ardashir.
Realizing the jeopardy of his position, the Persian resolved to put
Chosroes out of the way by whatever means possible. A Parthian of the
royal blood, Anak by name, consented to execute his king&rsquo;s
desire, and went with his family to Vagharshapat as a refugee. A
friendship sprang up between himself and his future victim, enabling
him to execute his purpose, which he did in company with his brother
while preparation was being made for a spring campaign. But the
murderers were cut off in their escape by Armenian horsemen and
precipitated into the Araxes, while the dying king gave orders to
massacre the family of Anak. Only two of the children were rescued, one
of whom was Gregory, the Illuminator, founder of the Armenian national
church, called also the Gregorian church. The child Gregory was taken
to Cesarea where he was educated in the tenets of
Christianity.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e1271src" href="#xd20e1271"
name="xd20e1271src">24</a></p>
<p>Ardashir died shortly after the murder of his foe, and thus failed
to follow up his advantage except for a few raids into Armenian
territory. Tiridates, a child at this time, was the oldest son of
Chosroes, and as heir to the Armenian throne was the chief obstacle in
the way of the ambitions of his uncles, whose treatment of the young
king compelled him to take refuge in Rome where he was
educated.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e1279src" href="#xd20e1279" name=
"xd20e1279src">25</a> Having distinguished himself by personal bravery
in a Gothic campaign, his nation&rsquo;s dominions were restored to him
by the support of a Roman army, for during his absence Armenia was
invaded by Shapur, the successor of Ardashir. The Persian king had
taken advantage of the disputes of Tiridates&rsquo; uncles. The
remainder of the story is legendary.</p>
<p>Gregory had been informed in the meantime of his father&rsquo;s
deed, and seeking to make such amends for it as he could, he journeyed
to Rome, where he attached himself as a servant to the exiled king,
Tiridates. The latter, after his victory over the Persians and his
re-accession to the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb31" href="#pb31"
name="pb31">31</a>]</span>Armenian throne, entered the temple of Anahit
in company with his faithful servant Gregory, to offer sacrifices of
thanksgiving. A feast followed the ceremony, at which many guests were
present, and Tiridates, who must have known of Gregory&rsquo;s
attachment to Christianity, commanded the latter to make an offering of
garlands to the great goddess. Gregory refused. The king was angry.
&ldquo;How dare you,&rdquo; exclaimed the king, &ldquo;adore a god whom
I do not adore?&rdquo; Persuasion and finally torture were used to
coerce the pious and firm-minded youth, but to no avail. In the
meantime, Tiridates had been informed as to Gregory&rsquo;s identity,
i.e., that he was the son of his father&rsquo;s murderer, whereupon the
king commanded that Gregory be cast into a deep pit where he was left
to perish.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e1286src" href="#xd20e1286" name=

<p>For thirteen years Gregory languished in his well, and was only
saved from death by the ministrations of a widow who resided in the
castle of Artaxata just by the pit. This was done in great secret, for
Tiridates had issued an edict which admonished his subjects to beware
of the resentment of the gods, of Aramazd, Anahit, and Vahakn, and
following the practice of the Romans, to lay hands on all offenders
against the gods, chief of whom, evidently, were the Christians. They
were to be bound hand and foot, brought before the gate of the palace,
and if found guilty their lands and chattels were assigned to their
accusers.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e1291src" href="#xd20e1291" name=
"xd20e1291src">27</a></p>
<p>While Christians were being robbed, and Gregory was slowly perishing
of misery in his prison well, there arrived at Vagharshapat a Roman
virgin of exquisite beauty, named Rhipsime, in company with her nurse
Gaiane, and thirty-three followers who were also virgins. They had fled
from the Emperor Diocletian, who had selected Rhipsime for his spouse,
after a most careful search of his kingdom for the most beautiful of
women.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e1298src" href="#xd20e1298" name=
"xd20e1298src">28</a> Rhipsime, unfortunately had taken a vow of
chastity, and there was nothing to do but to flee. Meanwhile an
ambassador from Rome arrived at the court of the Armenian king bearing
a letter in which Tiridates was informed of the flight of the virgin to
his land, and bidden to discover the refugees, to send Rhipsime to
Rome, and to kill her companions. The emperor added, however, in truly
generous fashion, that he might himself marry her if he was overcome by
her charms.</p>
<p>The band was found, Rhipsime was recognized, and the king sent an
escort of litters to bring them to his court. As Diocletian suspected,
the Armenian king also fell in love, for the maiden, having refused the
pomp of a royal equipage, was forced to appear before him in court. The
Armenian&rsquo;s suit was likewise a failure. Rhipsime would marry,
provided he became Christian, which the king took as mockery. Again the
girl <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb32" href="#pb32" name=
"pb32">32</a>]</span>succeeded in escaping, but she was tracked,
overtaken with her companions, bound with cords, and put to death with
great cruelty. Both Rhipsime and her nurse Gaiane are commemorated on
the calendar of saints, and at Etchmiadzin, the religious center of the
nation, there are three edifices; the largest and most important bears
the name of St. Gregory, while the other two respectively bear the
names of the two saints, Rhipsime and Gaiane.</p>
<p>Agathangelus relates the legend in his <i lang="fr">Histoire du
R&egrave;gne de Tiridate</i> but unfortunately the book has been
tampered with and now contains much questionable material.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd20e1310src" href="#xd20e1310" name=
"xd20e1310src">29</a> There are mentioned ominous thunderclaps,
openings of heaven, divine voices exhorting Rhipsime to stand firm in
her faith, and the transformation of Tiridates into a grass-eating boar
which was the punishment for his great crime. The sister of the king,
Khosrovitukht, had a vision, in which she was told that the only remedy
was to send for a prisoner named Gregory, who had been cast into a well
some thirteen years before. A rope was let down into the cavern, and to
the astonishment of all, there emerged a human form, blackened to the
color of coal. It was none other than Gregory. He also saw visions and
heard divine voices speak through curious openings in heaven. Strange
columns of fire and flaming crosses of light appeared to him in the
places where Rhipsime and Gaiane suffered martyrdom; and there appeared
a great deal more to him which is recorded, even as there must have
appeared yet more which is not recorded. The result of all of this was
that Gregory ordered the construction of two chapels, one to be erected
in honor of Rhipsime, the other in memory of Gaiane, both of which are
still standing in Etchmiadzin. Etchmiadzin means, &ldquo;the place
where the Only-Begotten descended&rdquo; for it was at this place that
Gregory beheld his miraculous vision. Having prayed for the healing of
the king, the horns fell from the royal head, and Tiridates, now a
Christian, shared in the work of constructing the chapels.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd20e1313src" href="#xd20e1313" name=
"xd20e1313src">30</a> He ascended Ararat and returned with huge blocks
of stone which he laid at the portals of the chapels in expiation of
his sin. It was customary among Armenians to place <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb33" href="#pb33" name="pb33">33</a>]</span>huge
blocks of stone at the entrance of a church by way of offering. Dubois
de Montp&egrave;reux saw a number of such stones, six or seven feet
high, in front of the cathedral at Etchmiadzin, but Lynch found no
trace of them.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e1318src" href="#xd20e1318"
name="xd20e1318src">31</a></p>
<p>Such are the legends of Gregory and of Tiridates&rsquo; conversion
to Christianity. In all justice, the highly imaginative material which
was probably the work of an enthusiast, and in all certainty a
surreptitious insertion in the work of the historian, should be
distinguished from the less fanciful material concerning the
imprisonment of Gregory and the martyrdom of the virgins, which though
legendary, may probably be connected with the events of history.</p>
<p>Although Dubois de Montp&egrave;reux recognizes that all traditions
point to the conversion of Armenia as having taken place before the
conversion of Constantine (in 312), he does not consider this as
probable, for Tiridates, as a tributary king, and imitator of the
Romans in all things, could not have had the courage to take so
important a step except in following out the policy of the
emperor.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e1325src" href="#xd20e1325" name=
"xd20e1325src">32</a> Gregory, according to the view of Dubois,
remained in his prison well until Constantine accepted Christianity,
when the Armenian king called for him and was converted as a matter of
diplomacy after listening to his exhortations.</p>
<p>But this is not accepted by modern writers, any more than it was by
the ancient historians. Bryce places the conversion at 302, and states
that the so-called conversion of Constantine happened either twelve or
thirty-seven years later, according as one reckons to the battle of the
Milvian Bridge, or his baptism.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e1330src"
href="#xd20e1330" name="xd20e1330src">33</a> Armenia, therefore, was
the first country that adopted Christianity as a religion of state, a
matter of no small pride to the Gregorians, and it has been maintained
as the national religion ever since in a form so intact as to surpass
the dreams of the most ultra-conservative. And this, too, in the face
of attacks by Persian fire-worshippers who attempted to force their
religion upon the people, Greek and Latin popes, Mohammedan khalifs,
and Turkish sultans. Ormanian, former Armenian patriarch at
Constantinople, who gives the date as 301, considers the existence of
the churches of St. Rhipsime and St. Gaiane with their inscriptions as
positive proof, and mentions also the testimony in the writings of
Eusebius, who cites the war of the year 311 which the Emperor
Maximianus, the Dacian, declared against Armenians on account of their,
at that time, recent conversion.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e1333src"
href="#xd20e1333" name="xd20e1333src">34</a> The critical studies made
since the journey of Dubois (1837) are conclusive at least in this,
that the conversion of Tiridates and of the nation could not have taken
place later <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb34" href="#pb34" name=
"pb34">34</a>]</span>than the year 302, and there is no doubt therefore
of the claim that the Gregorian church is the oldest national Christian
church of the world.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The conversion of the people followed close upon the
conversion of the king, for Gregory was a temple-building priest not
without ambition, and the king was an acknowledged hero. The business
of converting the nation was not a matter of priests and preaching as
suggested by Dubois;<a class="noteref" id="xd20e1343src" href=
"#xd20e1343" name="xd20e1343src">35</a> as indicated before, it was
rather a matter of fire and sword. Ormanian supposes that it was due to
the work of the Christian communities already established, whose work
was stimulated and encouraged by the king&rsquo;s conversion.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd20e1346src" href="#xd20e1346" name=
"xd20e1346src">36</a> &ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;the almost
instant conversion of the whole of Armenia at the beginning of the
fourth century, can not be explained but by the pre&euml;xistence of a
Christian element which had taken root in the country.&rdquo; And
again, &ldquo;The first nucleus of the faithful, by its steadfast
energy, at length succeeded in gaining the mastery over both obstacles
and persecutions.&rdquo; This does not seem to me to be correct, for in
the first place the Christianity of the first, second, and third
centuries was not the Christianity of Gregory; it was one of the many
forms of worship killed by Gregory; and in the second place there are
sufficient records to prove the wholesale destruction of pagan temples,
images, idols, and inscriptions as carried out by the king and saint,
and of the use of the sword in forcing the people to change their
faith.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e1349src" href="#xd20e1349" name=
"xd20e1349src">37</a></p>
<p>First, then, what was the Christianity of the first centuries? It is
clear that the ideal was one of communal simplicity of life. That it
was opposed to all hierarchies and established priesthoods there can be
no question. The irksome round of daily toil was idealized in the
fellowship of a common faith, the central point of which was the
indwelling of the Spirit of God. Hence baptism was the all-important
event, for through baptism the Holy Spirit descended into the human
heart even as into Christ when he was baptized by John in the Jordan.
Jesus was no God come to earth in human form by a miraculous
conception; he was the son of Joseph and Mary. Feeling his kinship with
God he was baptized, which ceremony was merely symbolic of the
Indwelling Spirit. These early Christians have been called
adoptionists, for the ceremony of baptism is said to represent the
adoption of the individual by God, or by the Holy Spirit, both
expressions having been used synonymously. Simple and pure, it seems
that the adoptionists came as near carrying out the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb35" href="#pb35" name="pb35">35</a>]</span>spirit
of the teachings of Jesus as any Christian sect that ever
existed.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e1356src" href="#xd20e1356" name=
"xd20e1356src">38</a> But how utterly opposed, how perfectly
contradictory to the brick and mortar religion of Gregory! That the
adoptionists were objects of persecution by the orthodox church is a
certainty, and it was very probably this sect that was referred to in
&ldquo;that stubborn heresy of their native land&rdquo; mentioned so
frequently by Armenian writers. The following picture was clearly set
forth in a disputation between two Armenian church-men occurring at the
close of the third century. &ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; says Archelaus,
&ldquo;over whom it was that the Holy Spirit descended like a dove? Who
is this one whom John baptized? If he was already perfect, if he was
already the Son, if he was already Virtue, the Holy Spirit could not
have entered into him. A kingdom can not enter into a
kingdom.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd20e1362src" href="#xd20e1362"
name="xd20e1362src">39</a> What is also to the point is the celebrated
formula of Nice (325) at which the nature of Christ was defined as
essentially and continuously divine. &ldquo;Christ a very God, begotten
of God, but not a creature of God; Son of God, of one nature with God;
who came down from heaven and took flesh, and became man, and suffered
and ascended unto heaven; who was before he was begotten, and who has
always been.&rdquo; The decision was in absolute contradiction to the
adoptionist faith, and it was legislated by this august council, that
the members of such faith, who were called Paulicians, after their
leader Paul of Samosata, should be rebaptized before admission to the
church.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e1376src" href="#xd20e1376" name=
"xd20e1376src">40</a> The recalcitrants were driven to the mountains,
where they increased in number as in strength until the persecution of
the ninth century. Both Agathangelus and Faustus of Byzantium were
silent concerning these people, and, one suspects, advisedly so.</p>
<p>Such was pre-Gregorian Christianity. How ridiculous to suppose that
the conversion of the nation was due to the firm roots already
established by the Christians when the Christians themselves had to be
converted!</p>
<p>On the contrary, it was the right of might that established the new
religion. The troops of the capital city were led by the king and
priest in such an image- and temple-smashing campaign as was never
before seen. Proceeding down the Araxes valley, the temple of the god
Dir was levelled to the ground; the temple of Anahit was stoutly
defended but to no avail; the temple was burned. One after another of
the most famous sanctuaries were destroyed; temples of Aramazd, of
Mithra, of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb36" href="#pb36" name=
"pb36">36</a>]</span>Nane, and of Anahit, many of which were defended
by the vanquished until overpowered.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e1387src" href="#xd20e1387" name="xd20e1387src">41</a> Shrines of
Vahakn and of Astghik were laid to waste to be replaced by Christian
churches which grew up over the ruins as if overnight; and if a temple
was destroyed, it was only to build a Christian church in its stead. So
construction followed in the wake of destruction, the old was
supplanted by the new, and when all armed resistance was beaten down,
the king and priest continued the work by preaching.</p>
<p>When the work was fairly under way the ambitious priest journeyed to
Cesarea in Cappadocia where he got himself ordained. This Gregory was
no meek-spirited adoptionist. He was the son of Anak, of royal blood,
ambitious, zealous, suffering and doing all things to gain his
ends.</p>
<p>In view, therefore, of the actual character of pre&euml;xisting
Christianity, and of the methods employed in converting the people, how
can one reasonably suppose that the &ldquo;instant conversion of the
whole of Armenia to Christianity can not be explained but by the
pre&euml;xistence of a Christian element which had taken root in the
country&rdquo;?</p>
<p>The state-authorized religion, however, did take root in the
country, and became inextricably interwoven with the self-consciousness
of the nation. It became the organ of national expression, and for many
centuries has been the very backbone of the people. If the molten
metals of national life had hardened during the reign of the Arsacidae
kings they were at the time of the conversion in a molten state, ready
to be remolded. This did not require much time. Old festivals were
carried over intact, except that they were given a new meaning. The old
national traditions, legends, and folk-lore were in the common
possession of the people, and there was no reason for discouraging
them. In fact the Armenian church even more than the state encouraged
them, for it recognized in them a source of solidarity and national
unity, as essential to the life of the church as its hierarchies,
liturgy, and calendar of saints. So much then was old; part of the past
carried over into the present to be carried over into the future. What
then was new? First the legends and traditions, already mentioned,
imbedded in the immediately past events of the new order. Legends of
Abgar, of Gregory, of Thaddeus, of Rhipsime, of Tiridates, passed like
magic fire from person to person, creating a common sentiment which
made the foundations of the new church absolutely secure. How firmly
this foundation was established is indicated by the reaction of the
church to the decisions at the Council of Chalcedon, where the dogma of
the dual nature of Christ was affirmed, in perfect contradiction to the
Nic&aelig;an dogma, and by the reaction against the Persian proposals
to accept fire-worship as the state religion. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb37" href="#pb37" name="pb37">37</a>]</span></p>
<p>I shall consider the second point first. As already stated, the year
428 marked the end of the Armenian Arsacid dynasty. The nation was
divided between Persia and Rome at this time, largely as a result of
internal dissensions. In the year 450 the Persian king sent a letter to
the Armenian princes, setting forth the excellence of fire-worship and
the foolishness of Christianity, and summoned the Armenians to accept
the Persian religion.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e1402src" href=
"#xd20e1402" name="xd20e1402src">42</a> A council of bishops and laymen
was held and a reply of unanimous refusal was drawn up. &ldquo;From
this faith no one can move us, neither angels nor men, neither sword
nor fire, nor water, nor any deadly punishment.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd20e1414src" href="#xd20e1414" name=
"xd20e1414src">43</a> A rather impertinent reply from a subject nation
to one which dominated it; but thoroughly characteristic of the
Armenians. The Persians did use fire and sword, and defeated the
Armenians in the plain of Avarair under Mount Ararat (451). But they
did not gain their end. An old historian wrote of the battle,
&ldquo;swords of slayers grew dull, but their necks were not
weary,&rdquo; and the Persian high priest having seen the utter
hopelessness of his project wrote, &ldquo;these people have put on
Christianity, not like a garment, but like flesh and
blood.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd20e1419src" href="#xd20e1419"
name="xd20e1419src">44</a></p>
<p>Already, only one hundred fifty years after the conversion, the
foundation of the church was secure. This of course was made possible
by the completeness of the work of its founders; but this in itself
would not have been sufficient. A common favorable sentiment had been
created, which grew up under the natural conditions of life, and
inasmuch as the legends described are part of the common beliefs of the
people, it may be inferred that they played an important r&ocirc;le in
the formation of this sentiment. The church, on the other hand, has
incorporated these legendary beliefs in its ritual and ceremony, and in
that way has given them the necessary sanction by which they are passed
on from generation to generation. They thus form part of the permanent
social tradition of the Armenian people.</p>
<p>The security of the church at this early time (450) was indicated
not only by the reaction of the nation to the Persian proposals of
fire-worship, but also by the reaction to the decision of the Council
of Chalcedon, at which, as stated, the dual nature of Christ was
dogmatically affirmed, in contradiction to the dogma established at the
Council of Nic&aelig;a (325), <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb38" href=
"#pb38" name="pb38">38</a>]</span>accepted by the Armenian church. But
at the time of the Chalcedonian council, the Persian difficulties were
taking place, the battle of Avarair having occurred during the same
year, and it was not until 491 that the Armenians held a synod of their
own which assembled at Vagharshapat, in order to take decisive
action.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e1443src" href="#xd20e1443" name=
"xd20e1443src">45</a> The decisions of the Council of Chalcedon were
rejected and the action was repeated at subsequent synods. Of the three
sees or patriarchates, the Roman at Rome, the Greek at Alexandria, and
the Byzantine at Constantinople, the latter was gaining in power, and
it was at the Council of Chalcedon that the precedence of the see of
Constantinople was recognized. Naturally, neither the Roman nor Greek
sees acknowledged the decision of the council, but later both Greek and
Latin churches revoked their opposition, and recognized it as the
fourth &OElig;cumenic Council. But the Armenian church would have
nothing to do with Chalcedon, in spite of Greek and Latin approval, and
since that time she has stood alone, absolutely independent of Greek
and Latin churches. Ormanian states: &ldquo;She set herself to resist
every new dogmatic utterance said to emanate from revelation, as well
as any innovation which could in any way pervert the primitive
faith.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd20e1449src" href="#xd20e1449"
name="xd20e1449src">46</a> The &ldquo;primitive faith&rdquo; may be a
slight stretch of point, but the fact that the Armenian church adopted
an absolutely independent policy, which separated her from all other
Christian churches, and to which she has steadfastly adhered in spite
of persistent Greek and Latin influence and efforts at domination, is
in clear support of my assertion that the social foundations of the
church were firmly and securely established as early as 450, only one
hundred fifty years after the work of Gregory and Tiridates.

have distinguished Agathangelus, the historian, from Pseudo
Agathangelus, the meddler, who evidently had religious interests at
stake. The former lived in the fourth century, and was secretary to
Tiridates, who unquestionably commissioned him to keep the records of
the events of his reign. He is spoken of by Moses and other ancient
historians as sincere and reliable. It is thus assumed that the
original work has been destroyed or lost, and that the Greek and
Armenian texts now existing are the work of an interpolater who desired
to weave the straggling skeins of religious sentiment into a single
garment by establishing an historic and literary sanction to the
religious events of the period of the conversion. There are many
indications of this, chief of which is the highly imaginative style of
narrative, undoubtedly designed with the particular intent of capturing
the minds of the people. (Langlois&rsquo; introduction to Agathangelus
1:99&ndash;108.)</p>

Langlois in his footnotes states that the chapel consecrated to St.
Gaiane was constructed by the Katholikos Ezdras in the year 630. and
repaired in 1652. The church of St. Rhipsime was built by the
Katholikos Gomidas in 618, and repaired in 1653. The main cathedral was
built by St. Gregory. They are situated in Etchmiadzin. (Dubois 3:213.

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There is a third and last body of Armenian legends
more closely related to the second group discussed than to the first,
and yet marked off in some respects from the second as well. They have
a distinct religious stamp like those we have just finished describing,
and they are all related in some way to the stories of the Old
Testament. The legend of Haic is related to the Old Testament, for Haic
was the great-grandson of Noah, but it clearly belongs to the first
group taken up, for the reason that it has to do with the origin of the
Armenian nation. The first body, including Haic, and the legends of
Semiramis and Ara, Vahakn, Artasches and Satenik, and Artavazd, are all
concerned with ancient Armenian kings, real or mythical, and all go
back to a time before the introduction of Christianity. Vahakn was
deified, but that does not exclude him since he was first a king. The
second group, including the legends of Abgar, Rhipsime and Gaiane,
Gregory, Thaddeus, and Tiridates, are all concerned with historical
figures, real or supposed, and there is no doubt about their historic
reality, with the exception of Rhipsime and Gaiane. But what marks them
off from the other groups is that they are all concerned with the
introduction of Christianity into the country. Those of the third group
have no historic value whatever. They are legends based upon legends
that date back to a period even more remote than the legend of Haic,
and their social value does not approach that of the first two groups.
They are all connected in some way, either with the Old Testament
legend of Noah, or with the legend of the origin of man. No traveler
ever passed through Armenia without hearing of one or more of them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month,
the ark rested upon the mountains of Ararat.&rdquo;<a class="noteref"
id="xd20e1467src" href="#xd20e1467" name="xd20e1467src">1</a> Every
Armenian, and others, too, believe that this is the Ararat of Armenia,
or Masis as it is called, and it is true that there is absolutely
nothing to disprove such a belief. James Bryce has given a careful
consideration to the question, and states in conclusion that full
liberty is left to the traveler to consider the &ldquo;snowy sovereign
of the Araxes plain&rdquo; to be the true Ararat.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e1470src" href="#xd20e1470" name="xd20e1470src">2</a> There are
several points that may be noted. First, there is nothing in the
statement of Genesis to show that the Ararat mentioned was a mountain
called by that <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb40" href="#pb40" name=
"pb40">40</a>]</span>name; it seems rather that Ararat was a section of
country, for the passage states that the ark rested &ldquo;upon the
mountains of Ararat.&rdquo; In the second place, the mountain is not
called Ararat by Armenians, but Masis. And thirdly, there is no
independent Armenian tradition of the flood so far as is known, for it
can not be shown that the modern tradition is older than the Christian
era.</p>
<p>These facts would be conclusive evidence that Armenian Ararat is not
the traditional Ararat of the Old Testament, were it not, first, for
the fact that there was in the region of the mountain a province of
Airarat which in all probability corresponds to the biblical Ararat.
Secondly, the biblical Ararat unquestionably corresponds to the
Assyrian Urarthu which is the section of country about Lake Van and
Mount Ararat. So that, although not absolutely conclusive, the Armenian
tradition enjoys a very high degree of probability.</p>
<p>In this connection the legend of the village of Nakhitchevan is
worth noting. It is situated just to the north of the mountain on the
left bank of the Araxes. Armenians believe it to be the place where
Noah first landed, and as proof, the name of the village, which means,
&ldquo;the first place of landing,&rdquo; is cited. One might suppose
the name to have been given by the Christians after the conversion to
Christianity, were it not that Ptolemy places in the same spot a city
named Naxuana which is the exact Greek for the Armenian name. Also
Josephus, fifty years before Ptolemy speaks of the place, as quoted by
St. Martin<span class="corr" id="xd20e1485" title="Source: ;">:</span>
&ldquo;<span lang="fr">Les Arm&eacute;niens appellent ce lieu
l&rsquo;endroit de la descente parce que c&rsquo;est l&agrave; que
l&rsquo;arche trouva un endroit de salut, et qu&rsquo;encore
actuellement les indig&egrave;nes montrent ses
d&eacute;bris.</span>&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd20e1491src" href=
"#xd20e1491" name="xd20e1491src">3</a> Tavernier who traveled through
the country along about 1700 speaks of Nakhitchevan as the
&ldquo;oldest city of the world&rdquo; and gives the
tradition.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e1494src" href="#xd20e1494" name=
"xd20e1494src">4</a> But many Jews, who undoubtedly gave the village
its name, lived in Armenia, long before the Christian era.</p>
<p>Situated on a broad plain four or five thousand feet above sea
level, Ararat rises majestic and solitary to a height of 17,000 feet.
There are no lesser peaks or ranges to destroy the grandeur of the
effect. Except for its companion<span class="corr" id="xd20e1502"
title="Source: .">,</span> Little Ararat, which rises beside it on a
common base to a height of 12,840 feet, it stands alone as monarch of
the broad plain it surveys. Little Ararat is in the form of a perfect
cone, whereas Ararat is broad-shouldered and dome-shaped, supported by
huge buttresses and capped with snow a considerable distance down the
slope through the entire year. It is truly symbolic of strength and
majesty.</p>
<p>Such is the mountain about which a thousand legends cluster. Marco
Polo says of the mountain: &ldquo;There is an exceeding great mountain
on which <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb41" href="#pb41" name=
"pb41">41</a>]</span>it is said the ark of Noah rested, and for this
cause it is called the mountain of the Ark of Noah.&rdquo; In 1254, a
little before Marco Polo&rsquo;s time, a Franciscan friar, William of
Rubruck passed by the mountain upon which the ark is said to have
rested, which mountain, he said, could not be ascended, though the
earnest prayers of a pious monk prevailed so far that a piece of the
wood of the ark was brought to him by an angel, which piece, he said,
is still preserved in a church near by as a holy relic. He gives Masis
as the name of the mountain and adds that it is the Mother of the
World. According to a Persian tradition it is called &ldquo;Cradle of
the Human Race.&rdquo; Still more interesting is the account by Sir
John Maundeville, part of which runs as follows: &ldquo;<span lang=
"en-1200">Fro Artyroun go men to an Hille, that is clept Sabisocolle.
And there besyde is another Hille, that men clepen Ararathe: but the
Jews clepen it Taneez, where Noas Schipp rested: and zit is upon that
Montayne and men may see it a ferr in clear wedre: and that Montayne is
well a myle high. And sum men seyn that they have seen and touched the
Schipp; and put here Fyngres in the parties where the Feend went out
when that Noe seyd &lsquo;Benedicta.&rsquo; But they that seyn such

Plankes down, that zit is in the Mynstre at the foot of the Montayne.
And beside is the Cytes of Dayne that Noe founded. And faste by it is
the Cytee of Any, in which were 1000 churches. But upon that Montayne
to gon up this monk had gret desir; and so upon a day he went up and
when he was the third part of the Montayne he was so wery that he
mighte not furthere, and so he rested him and felle to slep, and when
he awoke he fonde himself liggyie at the foot of the Montayne. And then
he preyde devoutly to God that he wold vouch saf to suffre him gon up.
And an angelle cam to him and seyde that he scholde gon up; and so he
did. And sithe that Time never non. Wherefore men scholde not beleeve
such Woordes.</span>&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd20e1512src" href=
"#xd20e1512" name="xd20e1512src">5</a></p>
<p>The legend of the monk is usually given in a form which confirms
still more the sacredness of the mountain. St. Jacob, as the monk was
named, tried three successive times to climb the mountain. Each time he
fell asleep intending to resume his journey the next morning, only to
wake up finding himself at the same point he had started from the
preceding day. An angel came to him after the third time, and told him
that God had forbidden mortal foot ever to tread on the sacred summit,
but that he should be given a fragment of the ark in which mankind had
been preserved as a reward for his devout perseverance.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd20e1520src" href="#xd20e1520" name="xd20e1520src">6</a>
This treasure is still <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb42" href="#pb42"
name="pb42">42</a>]</span>preserved at Etchmiadzin and the saint is
commemorated by the little monastery of St. Jacob, which till 1840,
when a tremendous shaking of the mountain showered the little monastery
with rocks of destruction, stood above the valley of Arghuri on the
slopes of Ararat.</p>
<p>The little village of Arghuri, the single village on the
mountainside, was the city of Noah&rsquo;s vineyard, and contained a
little church which is said to hallow the spot where Noah first set up
an altar.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e1527src" href="#xd20e1527" name=
"xd20e1527src">7</a> But this village<span class="corr" id="xd20e1533"
title="Not in source">,</span> too, was completely destroyed by the
avalanche of 1840. Not the slightest trace of it remains, though only
three years before its destruction, Dubois de Montp&egrave;reux visited
the little city and described it together with the church of Noah,
Noah&rsquo;s vineyard, and the monastery of St. Jacob.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd20e1536src" href="#xd20e1536" name="xd20e1536src">8</a>
In the garden of the city were planted pear trees, apple, plum, cherry,
apricot, peach, and nut trees. This very garden was the site of the
first vine on which the old patriarch became drunk, and the inhabitants
showed Dubois some bits of creepers to prove it. &ldquo;<span lang=
"fr">Dieu,</span>&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;<span lang="fr">pour punir
les ceps qui avaient ainsi entrain&eacute; le pauvre patriarche dans le
p&eacute;ch&eacute;, les condamna a ne plus porter de
raisins.</span>&rdquo; Na&iuml;ve, yes, but very sweetly so. And the
church, the people said, marked the place where Noah offered his first
sacrifice after the deluge. Except for the garden of Arghuri, wrote
Dubois, this great mountain was absolutely destitute of verdure; an old
stunted willow, wound about with snow and ice was the only other
exception to this. According to the legend, it marked the spot where a
board of Noah&rsquo;s ark had taken root and sprung up into a living
tree which the people venerated. One was not permitted to take away
even the smallest of its feeble branches.</p>
<p>All of this was blotted out so completely by the shower of falling
rocks and boulders that it is hard to imagine the places as ever having
existed. The primeval willow, the vineyard, the sacred church, and the
little monastery of St. Jacob have left not the slightest trace. The
bell of the old church is no more heard; the Christian service is not
chanted any longer on the sacred mountain of the Ark.</p>
<p>Of the numerous other legends associated with the mountain I shall
mention only two. One of them regards the summit of the mountain as the
site of Chaldean star-worship, and asserts that a pillar with a figure
of a star stood upon it.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e1549src" href=
"#xd20e1549" name="xd20e1549src">9</a> According to the same legend,
twelve wise men stood beside the pillar to watch for the star of the
East, which three of them followed to Bethlehem. The other is in
respect to the spring situated above the spot where stood the
monastery. A bird, called by the Armenians tetagush, feeds on the
locusts which are such a plague to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb43"
href="#pb43" name="pb43">43</a>]</span>the country, and curiously
enough, the bird is attracted by the waters of the spring. When the
locusts appear, the people carry their bottles to the spring and
filling them with the peculiarly charmed water, take them back to their
fields where they are placed on the ground to attract the tetagush. The
people of Syria and Palestine were much in need of tetagush and Ararat
spring water during the spring and summer of 1915, for the swarms of
locusts not only devoured the crops but also the leaves and barks of
the trees.</p>

<h3 class="main">Section 2. Khor-Virap and Erzerum</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">On the bank of the Araxes, in the plain of Armenia,
and in full view of Ararat are located the monastery of Khor-Virap and
the chapel of St. Gregory close beside it. An Armenian inscription is
cut in the walls of the portico of the monastery which marks the spot
where a monk, Johannes by name, appeared twice after his death saying
that he had seen Gregory the Illuminator. The chapel of St. Gregory
covers the traditional well into which he was thrown and imprisoned for
thirteen years by King Tiridates. Dubois descended into a sort of
tunnel, fifteen or sixteen feet below the pavement of the chapel, which
is part of an old fortress, and was shown the worn stones of a niche
where the saint prayed, as evidence of the thirteen years, quite as
though other pilgrims who knelt in the same place could not have
assisted somewhat the pious work of the saint.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e1559src" href="#xd20e1559" name="xd20e1559src">10</a> The spot is
only a few steps from the famous temple dedicated to the principal god
of the Armenians, Aramazd, and it seems clear that the pagan king
intended to make a sacrifice to his gods in casting the young fanatic
into the well. The temple was called Achelichad, meaning &ldquo;many
sacrifices&rdquo; because of the many offerings here given up to
Aramazd. With the era of Christianity, the name Achelichad gave way to
the name Khor Virap, meaning dry well. Gregorius Magistros, already
mentioned, brought the body of the saint from Constantinople and placed
it in the bottom of the well, where it served to cure sick
pilgrims.</p>
<p>There is a tradition that the Armenian city of Erzerum, not far from
the source of the Euphrates, marks the vicinity of the Garden of Eden.
The Persian king Khosref Purveez is said to have encamped in the
neighborhood and to have received a message from the prophet Mohammed
during his sojourn, in which he was offered the protection of Islam if
he would embrace the faith. But the king spurned the proposal and
tossed the letter into the Euphrates. Nature, horrified at the
sacrilege, dried up the flowers and fruits of the ancient garden and
even parched up the sources of the river itself. And so the last relic
of Eden became waste.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e1564src" href=

<p>In the same connection, there is a plaintive Armenian elegy,
composed in the person of Adam, who, sitting at the gate of paradise
and beholding cherubim and seraphim enter the garden, makes the
following defence: he did not eat the forbidden fruit until after he
had witnessed its fatal effects upon Eve, when, seeing her despoiled of
all her glory, he was touched with pity and tasted the immortal fruit
in the hope that the Creator, contemplating both in the same plight
might with paternal love take compassion on them. But in vain.
&ldquo;The Lord cursed the serpent and Eve,&rdquo; pathetically cries
Adam, &ldquo;and I was enslaved between them.&rdquo; The elegy closes
most touchingly,&mdash;&ldquo;When ye enter Eden, shut not the gate of
paradise, but place me standing at the gate. I will look in a moment
and then bring me back. Ah! I remember ye, O flowers and sweet smelling
fountains. Ah! I remember ye, O birds, sweet singing, And ye, O
beasts.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd20e1573src" href="#xd20e1573"

<p class="first">Because these legends are for the most part based upon
older legends, and also because some of them are known only locally,
they can not be said to have played so important a r&ocirc;le in
Armenian social life as the first two groups of legends. It would be a
mistake, however, to suppose that all of the Ararat legends have merely
a local value. Ararat is the center of the nation, the grand
geographical feature of the country, and many of the beliefs clustered
about it are held in common. In fact there is a very old belief which
considers the sacred mountain to be the center of the world, and to-day
it is the common point of meeting of the boundaries of Russian,
Turkish, and Persian Armenia. And this is no accident; it is because of
the veneration in which the mountain is held, and consequently, the
realization of the importance the mountain gives to any territory in
which it may be located. The belief that Ararat is the mountain of the
Ark, the legend of Noah&rsquo;s vineyard, and the legend of St. Jacob
are very commonly accepted. The primeval willow, the church of Arghuri,
the legend, or perhaps one should say, the superstition of the
tetagush, and the legend of the wise men in search of the star of the
East, enjoy a more restricted circulation. Furthermore, it is natural
to suppose that the legends centered in the destroyed city of Arghuri
have not been told as frequently as of old, and are therefore dying out
gradually, although they seem still to be very much alive. A legend or
tradition that is objectified in an old willow, in a monastery, or in a
garden, is likely to die out gradually with the destruction of its
object. But some of them will never die out, object or no object, as
for example the legend of the devout monk who tried to gain the summit
of Ararat in order to see the holy Ark. There is something in his
waking up each successive morning only to find himself at the same
point he had started from the preceding day, which will keep its hold,
whether there be a monastery erected in his name or not. And if the
vineyard has been destroyed the people may very soon find another. In
fact I should be surprised if in traveling through the mountain region
of Ararat, I was not shown the legendary vineyard. This, however, would
more likely be true of a legend that had a commercial value to the
community because of the frequency of travelers, which could certainly
not be said of Ararat legends. The same general valuation may be placed
upon the Erzerum legends. A legend of this sort is not believed to be
true, unless the legend upon which it is based is commonly believed in,
and it is certainly safe to suppose that a majority of the Armenian
people accept the Old Testament legends. This is important, for when a
legend <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb46" href="#pb46" name=
"pb46">46</a>]</span>is not a matter of implicit belief by a people it
has little social value. The elegy of Adam can not be properly said to
be a legend at all.</p>
<p>The preceding pages point out certain points of resemblance, and
certain points of difference between the two words, legend and
tradition, which require to be brought out at this point, first,
because of vague and loose current usage, and second, in order to
establish my own use of these terms. In the first place they are
beliefs, and here lies the secret of their social value. Let them be
disbelieved in and they may furnish material for entertaining
after-dinner conversation, but they no more have the power of welding a
people together into a nation, a caste, or a sect; they no longer have
the power of creating a common sentiment among a large number of people
or of creating a national consciousness.</p>
<p>And in the second place, both the tradition and the legend are
passed on from person to person, and from generation to generation.
When a tradition is defined as a belief that is handed down orally from
father to son, it is not at all differentiated from the legend which is
also a belief, and which may also be passed on orally from generation
to generation. Neither does a legend or a tradition change its
character when the meaning is represented by symbols cut in rock,
inscribed on papyrus, or written on paper. The event of inscription is
very often a part of their history.</p>
<p>But when it comes to a question of historic value we mark the
parting of the ways. A tradition, used in the sense with which we are
concerned here, is always rooted in an indisputable historic fact.
Consider the traditions of Islam that are centered about the prophet
Mohammed. They may have a thousand variations, may have embodied
falsehood after falsehood in the course of their transmission from
place to place, and from generation to generation, as most of them
unquestionably have, but they are traditions, nevertheless, because
they are associated with a character who is an undisputed historic
figure. The refusal of St. Gregory to offer garlands to the goddess
Anahit, and his imprisonment in the well during a period of thirteen
years is a tradition because the belief is associated with a historic
character. Compare this with the beliefs concerning Haic, Vahakn,
Semiramis and Ara, and the distinction is clear, for these characters
are all mythical. Artasches and Artavasd are generally recognized as
historical kings, and are so spoken of by Moses. As such the beliefs
concerning them should be classed as traditions. However, Moses as a
historian has been relegated to a secondary position by
Carri&egrave;re, who gave the work a critical examination. This would
make the beliefs concerning Artasches and Satenik and Artavasd purely
legendary, unless further research establishes more reliable sources of
which we do not know. The first group therefore are legends.</p>
<p>In regard to the second group of beliefs all having to do with the
introduction of Christianity, Bartholomew, Thaddeus, Gregory, and
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb47" href="#pb47" name=
"pb47">47</a>]</span>Tiridates are unquestionably historic; Rhipsime
and Gaiane are mythical; the historic authenticity of Abgar is also
questionable. We should therefore speak of the legends of Rhipsime,
Gaiane and Abgar, and of the traditions of Bartholomew, Thaddeus,
Gregory, and Tiridates.</p>
<p>The Ararat and Erzerum group are of course legends with one or two
exceptions. The belief concerning the scorning of the proposal of
Mohammed by the Persian king who was encamped on the Euphrates as
explaining the barrenness of the Garden of Eden certainly has to do
with an historic figure, and perhaps two. But it is a legend,
nevertheless, because both the prophet of Arabia and the Persian king
are accidental rather than fundamental to the belief. The fundamental
basis of belief is the legend of the Garden of Eden. The elegy of Adam
in explanation of his sinful conduct is neither legend nor tradition,
and the belief concerning the tetagush and the spring of Ararat is a
superstition. It results in a distinct type of conduct marking it off
from both tradition and legend.</p>
<p>I have stated my conclusions at various places, and it would be
pointless repetition to summarize them all. I shall therefore sum up
only the important ones. The first is that the legends and traditions
of Part One are an important part of a larger body of Armenian legends,
traditions, folk-songs, and folk-lore, and that their social value lies
in the power they have of creating a national sentiment. This national
sentiment is the direct result of a social process accomplished through
the medium of the traditions, legends, and folk-songs spoken of. An
analysis of the national sentiment of ancient Armenia would lead us to
the conclusion that it was made up of at least three elements: first, a
sentiment of loyalty to the state; secondly, a sentiment of reverence
amounting almost to worship for the past glory of the nation; and
thirdly, a sentiment of love for the country.</p>
<p>The last sentiment is an especially real experience to all
Armenians. Objectified as it was at first in the vast plains, the broad
river valleys, the mountain ranges, or simply in the soil that brought
forth its vegetation, it came to be objectified in a spirit of
independence and in the ideals of freedom and strength. These two
objects of the national sentiment of love, the one material, the other
immaterial, are not, however, to be dissociated in the social mind, as
I have dissociated them on paper. They are inseparable, the material
and the spiritual, and simply do not exist apart from each other. Only
the emphasis varies, symbolized in one case by the peasant&rsquo;s
kissing his native soil, and in the other by the far-away look toward
the summit of some distant mountain. And when this sentiment of love is
the most important of those sentiments that go to make up a national
sentiment, that is, when it dominates all the others, holding them in
subjection, there has come to be a national self. A continuous stream
of consciousness envelopes the national self, and inasmuch as it
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb48" href="#pb48" name=
"pb48">48</a>]</span>implies a highly-organized and well-developed
national self, national-self-consciousness is the larger term. It may
be objectified and examined especially at a time of injustice from
without, and even at the time of an obvious act of injustice by the
state which usually results in civil strife. The latter case is
illustrative of how one of the sentiments that make up the national
sentiment may be under the domination of another, the sentiment of
loyalty to the state being subordinate to the sentiment of love for the
country in this case.</p>
<p>That the national self is organic, i.e., that it is functional, a
vital, living thing which grows and dies is clearly brought out by the
second group of legends considered. This is the second general
conclusion. The legends and traditions mentioned in this group are of
course again part of a larger body, all of which have to do with the
introduction of Christianity into the country. The important point is
that from this larger body of beliefs there resulted a new national
sentiment, new because something had come to be incorporated within it
which was not there before. This something was a sentiment of loyalty
to the church, evidenced in the readiness to uphold and protect the
church with all its recognized encumbrances of hierarchies and
paraphernalia against all foreign intrusion, whether peaceful or
military in character. With the destruction of the state, this
sentiment of loyalty to the church largely absorbed the sentiment of
loyalty to the state. Reverence for the past glory of the nation went
on unchanged except in so far as the church intensified it as a means
of intensifying the whole national sentiment.</p>
<p>A loosely organized, heterogeneous group of people can not boast of
a national sentiment, nor of the united action necessary in times of
national crisis, as when a people go to war. This united action is only
possible where the diverse sentiments of a more or less heterogeneous
people have been woven into a national sentiment of the kind spoken of.
This weaving process, as I have shown, is essentially a social process,
and the materials by means of which it is carried on are largely such
as I have been describing, namely, the legends, traditions, and
folk-lore that have somehow grown up among a people. <span class=

<p class="first">As the materials of Part One are part of a larger mass
of legends, traditions, and folk-lore, the social value of which lies
in their power of creating a national or group sentiment, so the
festivals and ceremonies to be taken up in Part Two are part of a
larger mass of festivals, ceremonies, and rites whose social value lies
in the fact that they constitute a necessary vehicle of expression for
this same national sentiment. The festivals are a necessary counterpart
of the legends, as the latter are a necessary counterpart of the
former. Activity is one of the most fundamental of nature&rsquo;s laws.
The sentiment of love for an individual dies eventually in the absence
of some formal mode of active expression. But be the action ever so
little a thing, such as the laying of flowers upon the grave of the
dead, the visiting of a shrine, or the sight of some hallowed spot of
sacred memory, the sentiment is kept alive. To be sure a sentiment may
smoulder for a lifetime, even as a national sentiment may slumber for
centuries without a mode of expression, and then all of a sudden burst
forth into a flame, or awaken into life at a mere suggestion from
outside. Bereft of statehood, the sentiment of loyalty for the state
has slumbered for centuries within the breast of the Armenian people,
but how often, how too sadly often, has it not suddenly awakened into
hot, new life only to be pacified into slumber again. But the last
glow, the little flicker at the end is all that separates the living
embers from the dead ash.</p>
<p>How the Armenian church recognized the truth of this by putting into
operation a thousand various modes of action in which the new national
sentiment that it created has kept itself alive and fresh, may well
serve as an object lesson to many another church. She did not make the
mistake of imposing an entirely new body of festivals and ceremonies
upon the people; she utilized the past and carried over a number of
pagan festivals absolutely intact, which she clothed with a new meaning
slowly recognized by the people. These form the first group to be
considered. In the course of time she created certain new festivals
which constitute the second group. And then she identified herself with
all of the ceremonies of common life, such as betrothal, marriage, and
funeral ceremonies.</p>
<p>In this way the Armenian church has become absolutely and
inseparably identified with the life of the people, and the people in
turn have been held together into a nation which has continued to give
its artists and artisans to the world.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e1629src" href="#xd20e1629" name="xd20e1629src">1</a> What is
Armenia? The national Gregorian church; much as Louis XIV, when asked
&ldquo;What is the state?&rdquo; replied, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb52" href="#pb52" name="pb52">52</a>]</span>&ldquo;I am the
state.&rdquo; This is unquestionably an exaggerated view, but not as
much so as might be supposed, since the social life of the people is so
completely bound up with the church. The only betrothal and marriage
recognized is that sanctioned by the church. Whenever there is a common
danger, as has been the case repeatedly during the past twenty years,
the people flock to the church for protection. Such secret
revolutionary propaganda as has been carried on has been done largely
through the church. The young Armenian who returns from his academic
life in Paris, a sceptic if not an unbeliever, and certainly opposed to
the dogma and ultra-conservatism of his church, does not alienate
himself, for he realizes his utter impotence in any kind of work for
his people should he do so. In spite of the division of Armenia into
three slices, Turkish, Persian, and Russian, the church has retained
its hold, and if the position of the people as subject to Turkey,
Persia, and Russia has placed her (the church) at a decided
disadvantage in coping with the ever constant influence and propaganda,
schools, and missionaries of the Greek, Latin, and Protestant churches,
she has not at all given in, for the number of Catholic Armenians
amounts to only 3 per cent of the number of orthodox Armenians, while
the number of Protestant Armenians is only 1 per cent.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd20e1637src" href="#xd20e1637" name="xd20e1637src">2</a>
Considering, as I say, the utter helplessness of the church in
combating outside influences, these figures indicate how closely the
life of the people is identified with her. Perhaps her very
helplessness has been a source of strength.</p>
<p>These facts together with such little practices as I have mentioned
(and I might also note the custom of the Armenian peasant of crossing
himself daily at the altar of his community church before beginning his
day of toil)<a class="noteref" id="xd20e1642src" href="#xd20e1642"
name="xd20e1642src">3</a> are sufficient to show that the church has
been the chief means of keeping alive the currents of national life,
that it is a national church, and that it has identified itself with
the common life of the people. The festivals and ceremonies which
constitute the second part of my paper thus form the vehicle of
expression of the national sentiment, and are all connected with the
church.</p>
<p>The participation of the laity in church matters, especially in the
election of its officials, is a chief reason for the essential oneness
of church and people. Priests, bishops, and patriarchs, who constitute
the three chief grades in the religious hierarchy, are chosen by the
people.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e1649src" href="#xd20e1649" name=
"xd20e1649src">4</a> The approval of higher authorities is necessary in
most cases, but this only slightly detracts from the importance of the
r&ocirc;le of the people. A married priest is the religious head of
every parish, and he is elected either by a <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb53" href="#pb53" name="pb53">53</a>]</span>direct
process of voting or by a deed of presentation. The religious council
of the diocese proceeds to examine the ability and qualifications of
the candidate, who is ordained if his examination proves successful; if
unsuccessful, a new candidate must be presented, for a bishop can not
of his own initiative ordain a priest. The laity have no voice in the
election of the celibate priesthood, which is only natural since the
celibate priests are not in any way connected with the life of the
community. Furthermore, they do not constitute a very important
element, for when Ormanian wrote in 1911, there were only 400 celibate
priests as against 4,000 married priests.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e1660src" href="#xd20e1660" name="xd20e1660src">5</a></p>
<p>The married priest is very closely identified with his community. He
not only makes a regular practice of visiting the various households of
the parish, but he is sole confessor of the people.<a class="noteref"
id="xd20e1667src" href="#xd20e1667" name="xd20e1667src">6</a> As he
officiates at masses and church ceremonies and promotes a general
participation in the festivals, so also no betrothal, marriage,
baptism, or funeral can be sanctioned without his presence. He is as
well a kind of marriage agency, employment agency, and relief agency,
acting always of course in co&ouml;peration with the council of elders
of his parish. A priest called at the home of an Armenian lady I know,
and remarked casually that he was aware she had a daughter, whom he was
very anxious to see, for there were two young men of the community who
were very desirous to marry. So the people inform the priest of their
need and the priest does all in his power to help them. He does not
receive a regular compensation, being absolutely dependent upon the
voluntary offerings of his flock and the voluntary fees received for
official services rendered.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e1672src" href=
"#xd20e1672" name="xd20e1672src">7</a> This works out sometimes to his
advantage, but more often not, depending generally on whether his
parish is poverty stricken or well-to-do.</p>
<p>There are several very curious usages practiced by the married
priest. He is recruited from all classes of society, but more often
there is a succession from father to son.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e1680src" href="#xd20e1680" name="xd20e1680src">8</a> The
conditions demanded, besides parochial election, are acquaintance with
ecclesiastical and liturgical matters, an exemplary life, and the
consent of his wife. After his ordination he must fast for forty days.
He then prepares himself for his first mass by a life of retreat in the
church, restricting himself to a vegetable diet for twenty-four
hours.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e1683src" href="#xd20e1683" name=
"xd20e1683src">9</a> The wife, who enjoys a certain precedence in
society, observes a customary abstinence in the absence of her husband.
One week or at least three days before the celebration of the mass, he
keeps away from <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb54" href="#pb54" name=
"pb54">54</a>]</span>home, passing the nights within the church. He may
engage in domestic or even professional work so long as this does not
interfere with the duties of his calling. Should his wife die, he may
not marry again unless he lays aside his priestly robe, nor may a
priest ever marry a widow. These practices are not dead letters, except
that the custom of sojourning within the church for three nights before
mass has, in Constantinople at least, been reduced to a single
night.</p>
<p>The bishops are chosen as chiefs of dioceses by the council of the
diocese, six sevenths of whose members are laymen, the remainder being
ecclesiastics.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e1700src" href="#xd20e1700"
name="xd20e1700src">10</a> The patriarchs, including the Katholikos,
the supreme authority of the church whose seat is at Etchmiadzin, the
religious center of the nation, are chosen by an electoral assembly of
the religious heads (bishops or archbishops) and lay deputies who are
nominated by the dioceses as a whole.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e1703src" href="#xd20e1703" name="xd20e1703src">11</a> The eight
members of the synod, which is an advisory body to the Katholikos, and
the seven oldest members of the congregation at Etchmiadzin have equal
share in voting. The electoral assembly, so constituted, chooses two
candidates, one of whom is selected by the Czar. The Czar, after his
selection is made, sends a deputy to meet the successful candidate, who
is decorated and escorted with due ceremony to Etchmiadzin where he is
officially ordained. There are only two patriarchates besides the see
of Etchmiadzin, i.e., those of Constantinople and Jerusalem. The
corresponding patriarchs are likewise chosen by a national assembly,
six sevenths of whose members belong to the laity. The patriarchs of
both Jerusalem and of Constantinople acknowledge the supremacy of the
Katholikos of Etchmiadzin, who is thus head of the church, though not
infallible.</p>
<p>The site of Etchmiadzin is the old capital city, Vagharshapat, the
ruins of which are all but washed away; and it marks the spot where St.
Gregory in his vision saw the descent of Jesus Christ. Etchmiadzin
means, &ldquo;Descent of the Only Begotten.&rdquo; The particular spot
is commemorated by the central altar of the Cathedral, which is the
chief church of the nation. This Cathedral is situated in the center of
a huge court bounded in the form of a large rectangle by the cells of
the monks, the long refectory building, the library, the theological
seminary, and the residence of the Katholikos. Outside this rectangle
are ranged buildings and open spaces, including the garden of the
Katholikos, the court for pilgrims, the printing establishment, and
dwellings for various uses, all of which is bounded by a huge wall in
the form of a still larger rectangle about 1,000 feet in length and 700
feet in width.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e1709src" href="#xd20e1709"

from the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb55" href="#pb55" name=
"pb55">55</a>]</span>monastery, the church of St. Gaiane, commemorating
the spot of her martyrdom, being about one fourth of a mile distant,
while the church of St. Rhipsime, which likewise honors the spot of
Rhipsime&rsquo;s martyrdom, is about three fourths of a mile distant.
The buildings now standing can hardly be those built by the
saint.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e1717src" href="#xd20e1717" name=
"xd20e1717src">13</a></p>
<p>Etchmiadzin has been for many years a place of pilgrimage for the
faithful. There is not only the sacred Cathedral where Jesus Christ is
believed to have appeared; there is also the chamber of holy relics in
the rear of the Cathedral which is perhaps the chief attraction and
glory of the place. The most important of the relics here kept is a
hand of St. Gregory, or rather right arm, &ldquo;atch,&rdquo; as it is
called, now preserved in a silver case, and which was considered at one
time to be a necessary appanage of the patriarchal dignity. The poor
hand of the saint has been the cause of many peregrinations in
consequence.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e1723src" href="#xd20e1723"
name="xd20e1723src">14</a> One patriarch seized it and carried it off
with him in order to justify his claims. Another restole it and brought
it back to Etchmiadzin, while others have pretended possession of the
holy &ldquo;atch,&rdquo; in order to make good their claims. It was
with this relic as well as with the holy chrism that consecrations were
performed, which made possession of it a necessary condition of the
patriarchal authority. Another much revered relic is the fragment of
the ark, which the angel who appeared to St. Jacob gave to him as a
reward for his perseverance in attempting so impossible a task as the
climbing of Ararat. Still another is the head of the &ldquo;holy
spear&rdquo; which was thrust into the side of Christ by the Roman
soldier at Golgotha.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e1726src" href=
"#xd20e1726" name="xd20e1726src">15</a> There are others of lesser
importance, some of which are believed to possess the power of
effecting cures.</p>
<p>Such in brief are the broader and more important facts relating to
the church, which has thus come to sanction the festivals and
ceremonies that make up the second part of this thesis. These, as I
have said, naturally divide themselves into three groups, first those
that have been taken over bodily from the past; second, new festivals
and ceremonies created by the church; and third the ceremonies of
common life with which the church has identified itself. In the first
group are included the midsummer festival of Vartavar, the spring
festival, the festival in commemoration of the dead, Fortune-Telling
Day, and the festival of Vartan&rsquo;s Day. All except the last have
their origin in pagan festivals; each one has been taken over by the
church and made its own. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb56" href=

<h3 class="main">Section 1. Vartavar and the Festival of Mihr</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Vartavar, meaning &ldquo;flaming of the rose,&rdquo;
was celebrated in pagan times in honor of Anahit, goddess of chastity,
at midsummer. The central act of the festival was the offering of a
dove and a rose to her golden image. With the introduction of
Christianity the temple and the image were destroyed, and it may be
noted that upon the site of the Temple of Anahit in Vagharshapat was
built the Cathedral of Etchmiadzin. This would lead to the strange
conclusion that in the vision of St. Gregory, Jesus Christ descended
upon a pagan temple. The fact seems to be that this marvelous vision
was seen by a pious monk who published a life of St. Gregory some two
or three centuries after the Illuminator&rsquo;s death.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd20e1750src" href="#xd20e1750" name="xd20e1750src">1</a>
But the festival became the &ldquo;Festival of the Transfiguration of
Christ,&rdquo; although the name Vartavar still remains, and doves are
still set flying.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e1753src" href="#xd20e1753"
name="xd20e1753src">2</a></p>
<p>The festival is celebrated differently in various places. Upon the
mountains of Armenia every family brings a sheep for sacrifice, adorned
with colored papers and pigments, and as the sheep approach the shrine,
lighted candles are fixed upon their horns.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e1758src" href="#xd20e1758" name="xd20e1758src">3</a> Sheaves of
grain, fruit, flowers, and doves are also brought as sacrifices, while
dust from beside the altar is carried home to children as a talisman to
help them to learn their A B C&rsquo;s. In the absence of a church on
the mountainside, which is usually the case, a large white tent with
crosses is put up beside some sacred spring, with which the country
abounds. The spring is necessary, for on this day the people amuse
themselves by throwing water upon each other. For this reason the day
is often called Armenian Water Day. After the doves are set flying, the
priest sprinkles the people, and they in turn sprinkle water over each
other. This practice probably dates to the legend of the deluge, the
Universal Baptism with which God cleansed His sinful earth. The dove
and the baptism are also suggestive of the baptism of Jesus by John in
the waters of Jordan. This part of the festival is probably an addition
to the pagan rite, for the sprinkling of the water is symbolic of love
and forgiveness; it is carried on with much laughing and merry-making.
The festival includes also a kind of fair, for the people have to show
what progress they have made during the year in art and the various
handicrafts. Races, competitions, and games are held, and the victors
are crowned with wreaths of roses, so that even the rose continues to
have <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb57" href="#pb57" name=
"pb57">57</a>]</span>an important place in the festivities as it had in
pagan days. The sprinkling of water, the games, the races, show how
happy a time the people must have on this day; the exhibition of the
year&rsquo;s accomplishment in handicraft and art points out the more
serious side; while the essential religious symbolism is very clearly
emphasized. What may also be noted is that there is entertainment for
all, old and young, serious and frivolous. The pious-minded may sit on
the mountainside contemplating the religious aspect of it all; the gay
and light-hearted may sprinkle water over each other; the young and
strong may run races and play games; men and women of a practical turn
of mind may visit the fair and note the progress made during the year;
and children may roll about on the mountainsides or gather roses, for
these are in full bloom at this time.</p>
<p>The pagan spring festival in honor of Mihr, the god of fire, was
taken over by the church to commemorate the bringing of the Babe Jesus
to the temple, where Mary sacrificed two doves according to the custom
of purification.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e1766src" href="#xd20e1766"
name="xd20e1766src">4</a> The ancient rite consisted of kindling fires
in the open market places in honor of the god Mihr, and of lighting a
lantern from one of the newly kindled fires, which was kept burning in
the temple throughout the year. As now celebrated, on February 26,
every young man who has been married within the year brings a load of
aromatic shrubs, making a huge pile of them in the yard of the church.
A religious service is held in the open air at evening-time, after
which the priest sets fire to the pile. All the villagers, men, women,
and children, dance about the fire, while boys and young men show their
agility and courage by leaping over it. When the flames die down, each
person carries home a glowing brand and places it on the hearthstone
for good luck.</p>
<p>The description of the festival by Abeghian shows how a general
celebration of this kind varies in particulars from place to
place.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e1774src" href="#xd20e1774" name=
"xd20e1774src">5</a> On the afternoon of the 13th of February,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd20e1777src" href="#xd20e1777" name="xd20e1777src">6</a>
which is the day before the church festival of the purification, a pile
of wood consisting usually of thorn-wood, cane, and straw is gathered
together in the churchyard. The entire community comes together in the
church on the night of the same day, each person provided with a
candle. After the vespers all stand about the pile of shrub and wood,
the newly married during the year making the first row. The candles are
lighted from the church light, and after the priest has blessed the
pile, it is set ablaze from all sides, after which the candles are put
out. As soon as the fire has died down, the candles are relighted from
the glowing embers which are regarded as sacred, and carried home
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb58" href="#pb58" name=
"pb58">58</a>]</span>where they are used to light a pile of shrub and
wood that has been gathered on the roof of the house. The young people
jump over the fire while the young women and married women march around
it saying, &ldquo;May it not itch me, and may I not receive any
scabs,&rdquo; taking care just to singe the border of their dresses.
The ashes, as well as the half-burned wood-stuffs are preserved, or
scattered in the four corners of the barn, over the fields or in the
garden, for the ashes and flames of the firebrands are believed to
protect people and cattle from sickness and the fruit trees from worms
and caterpillars. In the homes of the newly married the festival is
celebrated with music and dance, the young couples especially making it
a point to dance about the sacred flames, while in some places special
food is prepared in honor of the occasion.</p>
<p>Various prophesies are made during the festival, for example, if the
flame and smoke blows to the east, it is a sign of a good harvest for
the coming year, if toward the west, a bad growth is expected.</p>
<p>In recent years the religious authorities at Etchmiadzin printed the
following prohibition in the church calendar: &ldquo;It is forbidden to
run about the fire.&rdquo; But the festival is celebrated
nevertheless.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e1786src" href="#xd20e1786"
name="xd20e1786src">7</a> That it originates in the pagan festival held
in honor of Mihr there is little doubt, for the month of February
corresponds to the ancient Armenian month Mehakan, which, translated
into modern Armenian, Mihragan, means belonging to Mihr, or more
loosely, the Festival of Mihr.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Section 2. The Day of the Dead and Vartan&rsquo;s
Day</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The festival in commemoration of the dead is
celebrated on the first day after Easter, and may be regarded as a
reaction against the lenten fasts. Families of Armenians, loaded with
picnic baskets, packages of food, and bottles of wine, flock to their
cemeteries in great numbers. Priests are paid small fees for standing
over the graves of the dead to chant prayers for the salvation of the
departed souls. Over the graves of the recently dead stand the bereaved
relatives of the deceased, lamenting loudly and bewailing a fate which
they know must some day be their own. A more maudlin spectacle could
not be imagined. Here and there are seated groups of families eating
and drinking and laughing all the more heartily for the enforced
abstinence of the preceding weeks; while standing beside this grave or
that is a priest in black robe and high hat, chanting a prayer for the
dead, and incidentally earning his daily bread. Eating seems to be the
chief amusement; even the mourners eat after they have faithfully
mourned, and the priests too come in for their shares after all
possible fees have been earned. Altogether it is a post-lenten festival
in the full meaning of the term, and much in contrast to the wholesome
enjoyment and the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb59" href="#pb59"
name="pb59">59</a>]</span>light-hearted gaiety so characteristic of
Vartavar. It has been witnessed in Constantinople by Armenians I know,
who have given accounts to me. Whether or not it is carried out in this
manner in the villages and rural districts I am not aware, but I should
be very much surprised to learn that it was, for I should certainly
regard the festival in this form as a product of the artificiality of
city life. In the absence of wholesome amusements and of the community
solidarity characteristic of the Armenian village, contact with
city-bred folk would inevitably result in a shift of standards of
judgment and valuation, together with a break-up in old habits of
thought and life; and as the people have no common play-ground, so to
speak, except the poor denuded cemetery allotted them by the Turkish
government, one can well excuse the ugliness of the spectacle. The
Armenian has Vartavar, a real festival, and need not look with shame
upon this festival in commemoration of the dead.</p>
<p>This same offering of sacrifice for the dead is carried on in a
variety of ways. In Armenian villages the family of the deceased
prepares a lamb or a kid with rice, and on the day of the funeral
pieces of it are given to the attendants; given, as they say, and
taken, in sacrifice for the dead. The practice in Constantinople is
somewhat different, although the idea is exactly the same. Forty days
after the death of an individual, or perhaps on the anniversary of the
death, the bereaved family prepares a lamb or a kid with rice, which is
distributed to the people in small pots, and given, as they say, in
sacrifice for the dead. The Greek custom in this respect is most
absurd. At the head of the casket, which is left open, two men march in
the funeral procession carrying a wide tray filled with boiled wheat
and sugar, and trailing a piece of black crape. After the burial this
is distributed to the mourners in handfuls, again in sacrifice for the
dead. Libations set aside and poured out in Roman days are illustrative
of the same thing. That these practices are not Christian but distinct
survivals of pagan festivals and customs is very clear.</p>
<p>The above conclusions, namely, first that the festival as I
described it is an aberration of city life, and second, that although
identified with the church it is distinctly pagan in character, are
borne out by Abeghian, whose material, as an Armenian who for many
years lived in the little Armenian village of Astapat, is distinctly
first-hand.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e1800src" href="#xd20e1800" name=
"xd20e1800src">8</a> Worship of the deceased, he says, begins
immediately after death. Each departed soul, and especially those of
elderly people, requires particular honor on the first day after death,
and during the ensuing year. It is for this reason a great misfortune
for an Armenian peasant not to have a child. A still greater
misfortune, however, it is to die in a strange land where there are
none to care for the departed soul. That a curious evolution has taken
place <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb60" href="#pb60" name=
"pb60">60</a>]</span>in these requirements is very clear. In the
beginning, satisfactions of a material kind were required, something to
eat and to drink, and accordingly the custom arose of placing bread
upon the heart of the dead, or sanctified bread in the cavity of the
mouth and incense in the nostrils. Then there arose the idea of
facilitating the journey of the departed into the beyond, and of making
the future life of the soul a happier one. For example, Armenians
generally bathe the bodies of their dead in blessed water, and wash the
clothes of the deceased on the day following burial for the
purification of the soul so that it may arrive spotless at its
destination. Since the soul has been cleansed of all sin through the
symbolic washing of the body and clothes, no more covering is required
for the body than a large white cloth. No other color is permissible.
Should the deceased be more than ten years of age, candles or oil lamps
are burned during eight days over the spot where the body was bathed in
order to lighten the way of the soul into the beyond. According to old
beliefs, the destination of the departed soul is a place of darkness,
and hence two candles are placed in the hands of the dead immediately
after the bath in order that he may recognize his friends and relatives
in the world beyond. At frequent intervals during the first year, food
and drink are brought to the cemetery, and placed upon the grave. There
is weeping, eating, and drinking at these times, and what food is left
over is always placed over the grave.</p>
<p>The souls of the righteous are thought of as luminous, the wicked as
black. Accordingly the blessed are called &ldquo;spirits of
light.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd20e1812src" href="#xd20e1812"
name="xd20e1812src">9</a> In order to possess a bright soul one must
have performed good works, of which giving alms to the poor is
considered the most important. Such spirits are also called
&ldquo;generous,&rdquo; &ldquo;charitable.&rdquo; It is a current
belief that the blackened souls become brighter through the good works
of descendants, as well as through their prayers. Offspring are thus
especially desirable, and the old Armenian liturgy, the
<i>Maschtotz</i> prepared by St. Mesrob, the inventor of the Armenian
alphabet in the fifth century, contains innumerable prayers for the
dead.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e1818src" href="#xd20e1818" name=
"xd20e1818src">10</a> The prayers are short and their power is relative
to the frequency of repetition rather than to the length. Some sort of
short prayer is repeated with every thought of the dead, as for
example, &ldquo;May God have mercy upon his soul&rdquo;; &ldquo;May his
soul become lightened&rdquo;; or only &ldquo;The illuminated
soul.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Several days of the year are set apart for particular remembrance of
the dead.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e1825src" href="#xd20e1825" name=
"xd20e1825src">11</a> At these times the departed spirits are supposed
to come down from heaven and to roam about the vicinity of their graves
or in the homes of their relatives. On the eve of these days it is
necessary to do honor to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb61" href=
"#pb61" name="pb61">61</a>]</span>their memory with incense and
candles, which are regarded as offerings. The odor of the incense is
especially pleasant to spirits, for the incense-tree also blooms in
paradise.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e1830src" href="#xd20e1830" name=
"xd20e1830src">12</a> Saturday night is very commonly devoted to such
intercession and worship. Incense is burned upon the hearth while
prayers are repeated, or a flame is ignited upon a plate which is
carried into all the corners of the house, or barn, or wherever it is
believed the departed spirit may be wandering. In some places it is
customary to maintain the &ldquo;light of the dead&rdquo; throughout
the night in order that the spirits may enter the house. If they find
the house dark in looking through the roof window, they make away,
cursing. Water is not drunk in the dark during these nights, for it is
believed that to do so would be to take it away from the thirsty
spirits of the dead.</p>
<p>On the Day of the Dead the spirits are especially honored, for they
love most to wander in the neighborhood of their graves. People
actually feel themselves to be among the souls of the dead on this
celebration day. The latter are very happy to be thought of, and are
especially glad to have their graves blessed by the priests. But to
please them most one must bring wood and incense and leave it to be
burned over their graves. Three days the spirits remain upon the earth,
after which they return to heaven, their visit having been duly
honored. If they come to find themselves forgotten, they curse their
relatives and fly away in despair. Occasionally they come down to be of
service; especially is this true of the dead father and his living son,
for the former is especially remembered, and his grave is regarded as
holy. Armenians swear by the graves, or by the spirits of their
fathers, and call upon them for help in time of especial need.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd20e1835src" href="#xd20e1835" name=
"xd20e1835src">13</a></p>
<p>Tavernier described the same festival in his <i>Voyages</i> and
noticed that it was considered the greatest infamy to eat with a
&ldquo;Mordischou,&rdquo; the person who washed the dead.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd20e1845src" href="#xd20e1845" name=
"xd20e1845src">14</a> No single festival and group of relevant beliefs
is more instructive in showing how much of Armenian folk-belief and
custom is the survival of paganism.</p>
<p>There is yet another festival of this group, which, however, is not
to be traced to paganism, and it would be a mistake to suppose that the
church is connected with it in the same way and to the same extent as
it is with the first three festivals considered. The festival is called
Vartan&rsquo;s Day, and although the church sanctions the festival and
sets apart a day for the celebration, it comes about as near being
apart from the church as any single festival. Vartan was the general of
the Armenian army defeated at the battle of Avarair, spoken of in Part
One, by the Persian fire-worshippers who endeavored to impose their
religion upon the Armenians at a time when part of Armenia was under
the domination of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb62" href="#pb62"
name="pb62">62</a>]</span>Persia, and the remainder tributary to Rome.
But though defeated in battle, the moral victory, as people now use the
term, was Armenian, for the battle proved the utter failure of the
Persians to convert the Armenian people to their religion.<a class=

"xd20e1852src">15</a> Vartan saved the nation for Gregorian
Christianity, and it is significant that the people look upon Vartan as
saviour of the nation rather than as saviour of their religion, showing
how the religion was and still is identified with the nation.</p>
<p>It is in his honor that the people hold a festival on the
anniversary day of the battle of Avarair. School children sing songs
and wreath Vartan&rsquo;s picture with red flowers. The belief is that
this peculiar kind of red flower sprang up from the blood of the
Christian army. Recitations and national patriotic plays are given, and
as the children participate in singing songs, reciting pieces, and
rendering plays, the older people participate in attending
them.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e1857src" href="#xd20e1857" name=
"xd20e1857src">16</a></p>
<p>Besides the belief of the red flower there are numerous other
beliefs hallowed by the day. Nightingales that fly over the battlefield
are supposed to sing &ldquo;Vartan, Vartan,&rdquo; and there is a
species of antelope with a pouch of fragrant musk under its throat
which is said to have acquired its fragrance by browsing on herbage wet
with the blood of Armenian heroes.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e1865src"
href="#xd20e1865" name="xd20e1865src">17</a></p>
<p>Altogether it is the kind of festival to give expression to the
sentiment I have spoken of as love for the country, for its mountains,
rivers, and valleys, and for its ideals of freedom, independence, and
strength. In the presence of the state the festival probably would be
utilized to foster and give expression to the sentiment of loyalty to
the state. There would be specially chosen speakers to talk of
patriotism, waving of banners, and carefully designed methods of
instilling hatred for a real or supposed enemy, much as French school
children have been taught to hate Englishmen. But in the absence of the
state, the sentiment expressed must be a purer sentiment, loftier and
freer, and one can not but regret that Vartan&rsquo;s Day and similar
festivals have been suppressed by the Turkish government. And yet, one
could not reasonably expect otherwise.</p>

<h3 class="main">Section 3. Fortune-Telling Day</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Most charming and most picturesque of festivals is
that participated in by the romantic Armenian maidens on the early dawn
of Ascension Day.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e1877src" href="#xd20e1877"
name="xd20e1877src">18</a> On the eve of the same day the young girls
who wish their fortunes told, decorate a large bowl with specially
selected flowers, after which each girl casts a token, a ring, a
brooch, a thimble, into the bowl. Flowers of several kinds are then put
in, and the bowl is filled with water <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb63" href="#pb63" name="pb63">63</a>]</span>drawn from seven springs.
Then they cover it with an embroidered cloth and take it by night to
the priest who says a prayer over it. The most carefully and daintily
prepared bowl is then placed out in the moonlight, open to the stars
where it is left until dawn. At early daybreak of the next morning, the
maidens, furnished with provisions for the entire day, go out of the
village carrying their bowl to the side of a spring, the foot of a
mountain, or into an open field, gathering on the way various kinds of
flowers with which they deck themselves. Having arrived at their place
of festival, they play games, dance, and sing, after which they take a
beautiful little girl, too young to tell where the sun rises, who has
been previously chosen and gaily dressed for the occasion, to draw the
various articles out of the bowl. The face of the child is covered with
a richly wrought veil that she may not see what is in the bowl, and she
then proceeds to withdraw the articles which she holds in her hand one
at a time. While this is done some one of the party recites a charm
song, and the owner of each token takes the song which accompanies it
as her fortune. There are thousands of these charm songs, most of which
have been written especially for the festival, of which I shall give
but a few.</p>

<p>Thus each one carries its bit of prophesy, daintily and prettily
expressed, which when sung at the foot of some mountain, in the bright
eastern sunlight of the morning, while a little child is holding tokens
beside a bowl surrounded by the group of beflowered maidens, makes as
complete and charming a picture as one could well imagine.</p>
<p>Many curious beliefs, superstitions, customs, and legends are
directly related to Ascension Day. It is believed, for example, that on
the eve of this day the water of the springs, brooks, and rivers lies
peacefully motionless for a single moment during the night. At the same
moment heaven and earth, mountain and stone, trees and flowers beckon
and congratulate one another. First heaven congratulates and kisses the
earth, then one star beckons to another, one flower to another, and so
forth until all of nature&rsquo;s objects have expressed their mutual
good feeling. Even plants and &ldquo;soulless&rdquo; objects receive
the gift of speech and share their secrets one with the other at this
time. He who hides himself in a stone crevice of the mountainside may
listen to the conversation of stones and flowers, and understand what
they tell each other. They tell on this night what sort of sicknesses
they and the springs will heal, and many people endeavor to attend at
this moment, but only a few succeed.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e1962src" href="#xd20e1962" name="xd20e1962src">20</a></p>
<p>At midnight the waters are believed to have the power of healing,
and people bathe themselves in the streams. As the children are not to
be troubled during the night, water is warmed for them the next
morning, bits of grass are thrown in and the children are bathed.
During the magic moment the door of the cavern of &ldquo;Maher,&rdquo;
the revered hero god who dwells upon earth, is opened: and one may
enter to see him, his steed, and the &ldquo;wheel of the starred
heavens&rdquo; or the wheel of fate. In one of the national epics
(David of Sassun) Maher is represented as the strongest of the heroes,
and is supposed to dwell in a rocky cave in the vicinity of
Van<a class="noteref" id="xd20e1967src" href="#xd20e1967" name=
"xd20e1967src">21</a> (probably the rock of Van). In this cave all of
the world&rsquo;s riches are heaped up, and the &ldquo;wheel of the
world,&rdquo; the wheel of fate which constantly turns assigning to
people their destinies, stands there. Maher looks continually at the
wheel and if it should stand still, he comes out of his cavern to
ravage the world. The door of the cave is made of stone and covered
with cuneiform inscriptions. It is locked during the entire year except
for the night of the ascension of Christ, when it is opened during the
single magic moment. Whosoever perceives this moment may step into the
cave and take as much gold as he pleases. The idea of the &ldquo;wheel
of fortune&rdquo; is considerably extant, although it is not always
understood as separated from heaven and connected with Maher.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd20e1972src" href="#xd20e1972" name=
"xd20e1972src">22</a> That <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb65" href=
"#pb65" name="pb65">65</a>]</span>the idea of fate or of fortune is
generally associated with the day, not only by romantic maidens, but by
the people, is very evident.</p>
<p>The flowing waters are believed to change into gold during the
silent minute, and if one places an object in the water and wishes at
the same time that it become gold, the object turns to gold.
Accordingly the young men and women go to the springs and rivers in
order to draw water, trusting their fates that they may select the
happy moment. Superstitions and magic are not lacking, for while one
member of a party seats himself upon a pair of fire-tongs in the
fashion of a rider, another performs likewise upon a long-handled spit.
The iron tools are also regarded as a necessary protection against the
calls that one hears behind after the water has been drawn, for if one
should look back perchance, he would surely fall under the influence of
the evil spirits. The oldest of the party carries a gourd flask full of
wheat and barley, which is poured into the stream towards midnight with
the words &ldquo;I give you wheat and barley; you give me everything
that is good.&rdquo; Thereupon he fills the gourd flask with water, and
the party hurries homeward to discover the gold.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e1985src" href="#xd20e1985" name="xd20e1985src">23</a></p>
<p>The fortune-telling festival is given by Abeghian as he observed it
in his home village, and I shall give a free translation of his account
at this point because of a few interesting variations. In Astapet, the
festival is called the &ldquo;Festival of the Mother of Flowers.&rdquo;
On the day before Ascension Day the girls and young women of the
village divide themselves into two groups, one to gather special sorts
of flowers from the mountainside, while the other goes to
&ldquo;steal&rdquo; water from seven springs, or seven rivers. The
&ldquo;thieves&rdquo; must not see each other, nor must the people of
the village know aught of what is happening. Having filled their
vessels with water, each throws a stone into the spring and then they
turn back, taking care neither to look about, to set down their
vessels, nor to talk. They imagine that the mountains, the valleys,
trees, and meadows call out behind them and if they should turn about
they would be turned to stone.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e1990src"
href="#xd20e1990" name="xd20e1990src">24</a></p>
<p>At night of the same day the &ldquo;water thieves&rdquo; and flower
gatherers meet together in a garden to prepare the &ldquo;Havgir&rdquo;
or magic bowl in which is poured the water from the seven springs, and
in which seven stones from the seven sources, together with leaves of
the gathered flowers are dropped. Each one who wishes her fortune told
now throws in a charm token, such as mentioned before. Those who are
not present send their tokens in order to have them thrown into the
&ldquo;Havgir&rdquo; by others. The bowl is then adorned with flowers,
after which the &ldquo;Vicak&rdquo; meaning <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb66" href="#pb66" name="pb66">66</a>]</span>destiny
or fate, is prepared. This consists of two pieces of wood tied together
in the form of a cross, which is dressed and adorned with jewels and
pearls to make it appear as a newly-married doll-bride. The
&ldquo;Vicak&rdquo; is fastened to the &ldquo;Havgir,&rdquo; and both
are placed under the stars, in order that these who are the real
destinies, may work the proper magic upon the charm tokens.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd20e2000src" href="#xd20e2000" name=
"xd20e2000src">25</a> A few girls guard it during the whole night
against the young men who try to steal it.</p>
<p>Early the next morning the maidens gather together in the garden
laden with food baskets and prepared to make a day of it. The
&ldquo;Havgir&rdquo; and strangely fashioned &ldquo;Vicak&rdquo; are
carried to a nearby spring, the young girls decking themselves with
flowers as they go. The spring is decorated about with flowers, green
leaves, and branches, and the &ldquo;Havgir&rdquo; is placed in the
middle, and then after they have prepared everything and eaten, the
oldest among them takes the &ldquo;Vicak,&rdquo; kisses it, gives it to
another, who does likewise, and so it passes from hand to hand. Finally
a seven-year-old girl receives it. She sets herself in the middle of
the group and holds the &ldquo;Vicak&rdquo; while the
&ldquo;Havgir&rdquo; stands before her. The little girl is called
&ldquo;bride,&rdquo; is the interpreter of the &ldquo;Vicak&rdquo; and
is specially selected and dressed for the occasion. When she has
received the &ldquo;Vicak&rdquo; a red veil is passed over both, and
all is ready for the central event of the festival. A charm song is
sung by the group, and after each stanza the &ldquo;bride&rdquo; draws
a token from the vessel. The preceding verse reveals the fate of the
one to whom the token belongs.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e2025src"
href="#xd20e2025" name="xd20e2025src">26</a></p>
<p>The fortune-telling festival of Ascension morning stands quite
alone. Bodeful of the future and suggestive of the past, it can not but
have a serious tenor, for there are maidens whose lovers have not been
born, as there are also sadder ones. Perhaps they do not take their
verses very seriously. Whether they do or not there is always the charm
of sunrise colors, and the out-of-doors that makes it as beautiful as
it is romantic. The best of the future, their brightest hope, the best
of the present, warmth of sunshine and color, and the best of the past,
their golden dreams of youth, are brought together on this day and
given a common expression in a way that must charm them as it charms
the observer. Festivals to be perfect festivals must be out-of-doors
and the day must be bright. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb67" href=

<p class="first">The second group of festivals comprises those newly
created by the church, such as the Blessing of the Grapes, New Year,
Easter, and Christmas. I wish also to include in this group a few of
the peculiarly characteristic church ceremonies which also have a
distinct festival value for the people, i.e., the ceremony of the
&ldquo;Washing of Feet&rdquo; on Maundy Thursday,
&ldquo;Khatchanguist&rdquo; or the &ldquo;Blessing of Water,&rdquo; the
consecration of the Katholikos, and the manufacture of the &ldquo;holy

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The service of the church on any one of the festival
days is exclusively connected with the divine mystery, so called. These
include the Assumption, or Immaculate Conception, celebrated by the
people in the festival &ldquo;the Blessing of the Grapes&rdquo;; the
miraculous birth, which corresponds to the Christmas festival; the
Transfiguration, or the folk-festival Vartavar; the Redemption, to
which the Easter festival corresponds; and the Resurrection, including
Ascension or Fortune-Telling Day. There are other festivals celebrated
by the church, such as the festival of the Holy Cross, and of the Holy
Church, which I omit because there is not a corresponding social
expression. Grand mass is said at the church, and the particular
passages of scripture that have a direct bearing on the occasion are
read. The Armenian calendar is curious in that many of the festivals
occupy a succession of days; there are, for example, 39 days for the
Resurrection, 3 days for the Transfiguration, 10 days for the
Ascension, etc., which make up a grand total of 136 days in the year to
which festivals are assigned. As there are 160 days devoted to
abstinence, 117 of which are liturgical abstinence, that is, days of
penitence mentioned in the liturgy, there are left only 112 days for
the commemoration of saints, which have necessarily to be grouped
together, since there are more than 112 saints.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e2044src" href="#xd20e2044" name="xd20e2044src">1</a> Because,
therefore, of the continuity of festival days, one could not expect any
one of the festivals to have any social value from the standpoint of
the church service. But there is never any conflict between the
services of the church and the festivities without, which are thus
sanctioned by the church and in many cases directed and carried out by
church officials. It has been noticed that the blessing of the priest
was secured for the magic bowl, before it was placed underneath the
stars on the eve of Ascension Day.</p>
<p>The festival of the Virgin Mary, or the &ldquo;Blessing of the
Grapes,&rdquo; is more actively participated in by the church. It may
be designed to keep the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb68" href=
"#pb68" name="pb68">68</a>]</span>people from eating green grapes, but
more probably was intended to give a social expression to an otherwise
dull and very monotonous church ceremony. The people are all expected
to maintain a strict abstinence from eating grapes until the middle of
August, the day set apart for the festival. The grapes are then
gathered in great quantities, some of which are carried to the church
and placed on a large tray, which is set at the foot of the altar.
After the ceremony of the church, the priest turns to the tray of
grapes before him, which he blesses with his cross. The tray is then
taken to the door of the church, where each member of the congregation
is given a bunch as he passes out. The fast is thus broken with the
taste of &ldquo;blessed grapes,&rdquo; and there is no end of grape
eating on that day. During the remainder of the day every woman named
Mary, or named with a possible attribute of the Virgin Mary, as
&ldquo;Kudsa,&rdquo; meaning &ldquo;saintly,&rdquo; or
&ldquo;Dirouhi,&rdquo; meaning &ldquo;Mother of the Lord,&rdquo; keeps
open house for the friends who drop in to eat grapes and to
congratulate her. In rural places or villages where vineyards are
abundant, social groups may be seen eating grapes from the vines while
talking or playing as they are inclined. Grapes ripen earlier in some
parts of Armenia than in others, and where this is true the festival is
merged with the festival of Vartavar.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e2051src" href="#xd20e2051" name="xd20e2051src">2</a></p>
<p>For the festival of New Year&rsquo;s Eve no religious
co&ouml;peration whatever is necessary; it comes as near to being
distinct from the church as any of the Armenian festivals. The
preparation consists largely in making or purchasing gifts for the
various members of the family, in cracking bowls of nuts and getting
all kinds of dried fruits ready. Armenian and Greek New Year&rsquo;s
Eve fall on the same night, and in Constantinople there is much
agitation and animation in the streets. Singing and music fill the air,
and as soon as dusk falls, groups of boys, some carrying small
lanterns, others provided with tom-toms or hand-organs, begin the
circuit of the streets. Thus they go from house to house singing the
New Year&rsquo;s song and playing their hand-organs, receiving pennies
as they go. After the boys have passed along, the porters, watchmen,
and firemen make a noisy procession down the streets, they too playing
hand-organs and stopping at one house after another where they receive
a drink, some sweets and nuts, and most important of all, a tip. As
midnight approaches, the excitement increases; the pounding of the
tom-toms becomes unbearable, all the organs of the neighborhood are
making music, and there is such a noise of singing, shouting, and
laughing as can be compared only to a night of political election.
Inside the homes of the better-to-do, the children are put to bed for a
time while the enormous New Year&rsquo;s table <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb69" href="#pb69" name="pb69">69</a>]</span>is set.
Besides several specially prepared New Year&rsquo;s dishes, every home
must be provided with a dish of every kind of fruit, dried or fresh.
Small candles are stuck around the plates, and the presents are heaped
up on a side table. At midnight the candles are all lit, and the family
ranges itself around the table while the eldest, usually the
grandmother, blesses all and prays. After the prayer she wishes to all
the best things for the coming year, for the young ladies good
husbands, for the young men prosperity and good wives, happiness for
the little children, and comfort and health for the older ones. These
wishes having been given, all kiss the hands of the older members of
the family, after which the children kiss each others&rsquo; hands. The
presents are exchanged; fruits, candies, and nuts are partaken of, and
the fun goes on until dawn.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e2064src" href=
"#xd20e2064" name="xd20e2064src">3</a> In the interior of Armenia, two
elders of the church go from door to door of the more fortunate ones on
the day before New Year, carrying bags which they fill with the
offerings received at every house. These are carefully parceled out and
at dusk are left at the doors of poor families who would otherwise have
no New Year&rsquo;s cheer.</p>
<p>The church makes up amply in the Easter festival for any lack of
participation at New Year. Forty-eight days of rigid lenten abstinence,
during which time no meat is eaten, precede the festivities of Easter
Day. The first two or three days of the Holy Week are given over to
housecleaning, which however must be finished by Thursday in order that
the people may attend the ceremonies at church which continue until
Easter Day. On Thursday afternoon &ldquo;the Washing of the
Feet,&rdquo; to be described later, commences, and the service
continues until past midnight. On Saturday all go to the bath, which is
made an essential part of the week&rsquo;s celebrations, and on the
afternoon of the same day the real Easter service, called the Lighting
of the Lights, begins. The church is first illuminated on Easter Eve,
for on the three preceding days of mourning and sorrow the altar shrine
is kept closed and no candles are lit. Even the congregation holds
lighted wax candles while the triumphal songs are chanted by the robed
choir of little boys.</p>
<p>At the evening meal of the day before Easter the lenten fast is
partly broken by eating fish and boiled eggs, but no meat.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd20e2071src" href="#xd20e2071" name="xd20e2071src">4</a>
The denial of the flesh recommences, however, at bedtime, for not a
morsel is eaten until Easter midday. Early dawn sees the people putting
on their new clothes, especially new shoes which are considered a
necessity on this day, and all, newly attired, go to church where
communion is celebrated. The church is usually filled with flowers and
its most brilliant ornaments are displayed, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb70" href="#pb70" name="pb70">70</a>]</span>the
service ending at midday in time for the usual feast of stuffed roast
lamb, the customary red eggs, and the egg bread made only at Easter
time. In the afternoon the men visit from house to house and something
dainty is always served, a cocktail or a cup of coffee with sweets like
Turkish delight or bonbons. The formula repeated by the guest upon
entering a house is always the same; &ldquo;Christ is risen from the
dead,&rdquo; he exclaims, and is answered by the host with the usual
formula, &ldquo;Blessed is the resurrection of Christ.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Perhaps the boys enjoy Easter most of all. Provided with red Easter
eggs, they collect in groups, whereupon there follows a most vivacious
competition to win each other&rsquo;s eggs by clashing them together.
The champion egg is used until it is broken, when a new champion is
quickly brought forth. This process continues as long as there are two
or more unbroken eggs, the game being won when all of the broken eggs
are in the possession of the boy who holds the champion egg. Picnic
day, or the &ldquo;Day of the Dead,&rdquo; follows Easter Day, as I
have described it, and it is singularly strange that a &ldquo;day of
resurrection&rdquo; should be followed by a &ldquo;day of the
dead,&rdquo; when prayers are said and offerings given in sacrifice for
the departed. But people are not mindful of such little incongruities;
they are simple and carry out the festival celebrated by their fathers,
much as their fathers celebrated it.</p>
<p>The week before Christmas is likewise devoted to a thorough
housecleaning by the Armenian housewife, and on the day before, special
dishes are prepared for the next day&rsquo;s feast. Again there is the
customary bath which is observed by all the members of the household.
On Christmas Eve the abstinence of the preceding days is partly broken,
usually with fried fish, lettuce, and boiled spinach. Boiled spinach is
the rule because it is believed that this dish made up the supper of
the Virgin Mary on the eve of Christ&rsquo;s birth. At church special
vespers are sung and there is much emphasis laid upon special
selections from the prophets which are also sung. An hour before dawn
the sexton alone, or with a group of choir boys, goes from door to door
singing what is called &ldquo;the good tidings.&rdquo; It is the signal
for the faithful to awake, don their best clothes and go to church
again without eating breakfast. The holy bread and wine are not to be
profaned by the people having eaten a breakfast of ordinary food, with
the consequence that not a few faint during the service, even as at
Easter time. But the ceremony is finished by half past ten, after which
the women go home to prepare the midday feast while the men visit the
homes of their friends. The never-failing formula of the guest upon
entering the house of a friend is, &ldquo;Christ is born and manifested
to-day,&rdquo; which is responded to by the host with &ldquo;Blessed is
the manifestation of Christ.&rdquo; Each visit lasts about fifteen
minutes and sweets and coffee are served. At midday the Christmas
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb71" href="#pb71" name=
"pb71">71</a>]</span>feast is partaken of, all make merry around the
table, and in the afternoon more calls are paid and received. The
festivities are observed for three days, the third being ladies&rsquo;
day, which is devoted by the ladies to giving and receiving visits.
They offer their salutations and good wishes to each other, eating
dainties even as the men. Shops and business places of Armenians are
usually kept closed for three days.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e2085src"
href="#xd20e2085" name="xd20e2085src">5</a></p>
<p>There is thus considerable similarity between Easter and the
Christmas festivities, which is probably due to more or less sameness
in the church ceremonies. These ceremonies, always well attended, are
made attractive to the people by beautiful displays of flowers, vested
choir boys, the charm of whose singing can only be understood by those
who have heard them; also by special singing, not by the congregation,
but by those who can sing, and with such enticing little additions as
the Lighting of Lights. The services are thus as much and as real a
part of the day&rsquo;s rejoicings as the feasts and social visits, and
if they are designed consciously or unconsciously to give active
expression to the sentiment of loyalty to the church one must admit
that the expression is a perfectly free and natural one. Abstinences do
not make the festivities attractive, to be sure, and there are more
unfortunate communities who can not afford so lavish a display as
others; but flowers need only to be picked from the fields, and boys
there are always, even in the poorest churches. The holiday rejoicing
has somewhat more of the serious blend which is to be contrasted with
the more perfect gaiety of New Year&rsquo;s Day, and is probably due to
the weightiness of its religious significance of which one is
constantly reminded, not only by the services at the church but also by
the salutations of visitors and the necessary replies, always the same.
But even the gaiety of New Year is not to be compared with the perfect
lightness and freedom of merriment that characterize some aspects of
Vartavar, nor do any of the Christian folk festivals have the
completeness of Vartavar.</p>

<h3 class="main">Section 2. Special Church Ceremonies</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Together with this second group of festivals including
as they do Christmas, Easter, New Year, and the Blessing of the Grapes,
I wish to include a short series of church ceremonies all of which have
a very distinct festival value, beside their value in being singularly
characteristic of the Armenian church. They are distinctly different
from the festivals of the preceding section, in that the festivities
are incidental to a ceremony peculiar to the Armenian church. The
&ldquo;Washing of Feet,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Blessing of the Water,&rdquo;
the consecration of the Katholikos, and the manufacture of the holy
oil, are those I desire to describe. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb72" href="#pb72" name="pb72">72</a>]</span></p>
<p>The &ldquo;Washing of Feet&rdquo; occurs on Maundy Thursday, three
days before Easter.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e2098src" href=
"#xd20e2098" name="xd20e2098src">6</a> This day is the first of three
successive days of mourning spoken of, during which the altar is
closed, and no lights are lit. After the mass the bishop puts away his
brocaded robes, and kneeling in imitation of Christ washing the feet of
His disciples on the night of the betrayal, he washes the feet of the
priests and choristers, of whom there are usually eleven. Christ washed
the feet of twelve, but one of them was unworthy. The service then
continues until midnight, and while the ceremony is in progress, the
lights are put out one by one, to remain out until the &ldquo;Lighting
of the Lights&rdquo; on Easter eve. If the church is a parish church in
which a priest officiates, a number of little boys are ranged in order
for the &ldquo;Washing of Feet,&rdquo; which in this case is performed
by the priest, who anoints the soles of their feet with oil after he
has washed them. Each boy is given a walnut shell and before he moves
from his place he carefully scrapes some of the oil into his shell, and
carries it home to place in the butter. If he does this it is believed
that the supply of butter will not fail throughout the year.</p>
<p>This same service was observed by a writer in the <i>Survey</i>, in
a church on East 27th Street, New York, rented by a company of Armenian
folk residing in that city.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e2109src" href=
"#xd20e2109" name="xd20e2109src">7</a> The same symbolic &ldquo;Washing
of Feet&rdquo; was carried out on the evening of Maundy Thursday in
much the same fashion as it is carried out in the home-land. The
symbolism, the pageantry, the color of oriental Armenian worship, the
silver-mounted Bible on the altar in the center, the rising steps, the
crosses, the lighted candles, and the incense were all there. A
white-robed choir with green velvet copes filed in, singing long
chants. The choir was followed by two priests, and the priests by the
bishop with his mitre, robe of crimson and gold, and his ivory cross
held in the right hand with a kerchief of crimson silk. A shining
crozier held in his left hand marked his office as shepherd of the
flock; a large jewel locket and cross hung from his breast and was
probably the gift of the Czar. The choir chant that continues all the
while was described as an intricate, rhythmless tune, now passionate,
now wailing and altogether &ldquo;oriental,&rdquo; accompanied by a few
older folk here and there who were humming in unison with the choir and
the leader, who was beating time. Beside the humming the congregation
took no part in the service except that it stood up for the psalm and
prayer. Suddenly a sound to the right brought the observer&rsquo;s
attention to an old woman lying prostrate in the aisle. No one helped
her, no one even seemed to notice her, but presently she rose to a
kneeling posture and lifted her eyes in prayer to the altar. Again she
prostrated herself, and again rose to lift her eyes to the altar, which
performance was repeated a third time before the old woman <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb73" href="#pb73" name="pb73">73</a>]</span>took her
seat. &ldquo;Der Voghormia&rdquo; meaning &ldquo;Lord have mercy upon
us,&rdquo; was repeated ten times by the interceding bishop in a voice
loud and intense, and a second ten times, and a third ten times. The
chant quickened, and as the aged priest took the Bible from its place
and held it toward the audience the bishop gave his benediction of
peace to the &ldquo;four corners of the earth.&rdquo; There was another
chant after which the washing of the feet commenced. With deep
seriousness the bishop placed his staff by the altar, laid aside his
mitre and brocaded robes, and beginning with the aged priest, he knelt
beside a bowl of water to wash his feet. Ten more of those who came
forward shared in the ceremony. &ldquo;I can not so serve you
all,&rdquo; he said at the close of his address, &ldquo;I am sorry.
Take as symbolic what is done.&rdquo; There was a short intermission,
but before ten o&rsquo;clock the penitential service recommenced and
continued until midnight. The story of Christ&rsquo;s betrayal in the
garden was read, and the chants continued, wilder, sadder, and more
wailing, accompanied by murmurs and occasionally by low cries from the
people. As midnight approached the lights were dimmed one by one, and
the emotion became more intense. As the hour struck, the congregation
rose, and with clasped hands joined in a closing song and prayer. There
were only a few score people present.</p>
<p>The prostration of the old woman reminds one of the spiritually
wounded who lay prostrate over the floor during the times of the
Kentucky revivals, but the fact is there is nothing hysterical in this
particular phase of Armenian worship. The attitude is commonly
practiced by Armenians, especially among the peasant classes. They lie
flat touching their heads to the ground.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e2118src" href="#xd20e2118" name="xd20e2118src">8</a> But the
posture is more peculiarly oriental than it is peculiarly Armenian. No
sight is more common in the countries of Islam than the faithful Moslem
who spreads his bit of carpet upon which he kneels with gaze fixed
toward Mecca, prostrating himself repeatedly as he murmurs his
prayers.</p>
<p>Although the picture given by Dubois of a simple church service he
attended in Koulpe, Armenia, is not the ceremony of Maundy Thursday, it
has one or two strokes of native color that make it impossible to
omit.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e2126src" href="#xd20e2126" name=
"xd20e2126src">9</a> The church was poor and simple, the walls were
built of stone cemented by clay or bad lime. Two rows of large beams
neither squared nor trimmed supported the earthen roof in the manner of
columns. At the farther end was a kind of niche, partitioned off by
means of soiled curtains, thus forming a sanctuary where stood the
priest, clothed in torn robe, to read the prayers. All of the little
boys of the village encircled him, kneeling and chanting or reciting
prayers, turn by turn. The eldest placed themselves outside of the
choir and knelt on straw mats or on sheep&rsquo;s skins which
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb74" href="#pb74" name=
"pb74">74</a>]</span>marked their customary places, and kissed the
earth, or murmured very low the words of the priest, or responded to
the chanting at high pitch. The women held themselves apart, their
faces half veiled, filling the back of the church behind the men, and,
with lowered heads, were the first to leave.</p>
<p>The kneeling posture and the prostration is again clearly in
evidence, which together with what has been said is sufficient to show
that this attitude, especially among the common people, is a very
ordinary one and is therefore to be regarded merely as a very generally
recognized posture of worship, and not at all significant necessarily
of &ldquo;conviction of sin&rdquo; or a &ldquo;feeling of
penitence,&rdquo; which is nevertheless suggested. The church at Koulpe
must have been a very poor one not to have benches, but it had its
little chorus of boys, and the people participated in much the same way
as in the little church in New York, although nearly a hundred years
have passed since Dubois attended the simple service.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Khatchahankist,&rdquo; meaning literally, &ldquo;repose of
the cross,&rdquo; is the second of the four church ceremonies I shall
describe. The ceremony might better be named &ldquo;the Blessing of the
Water,&rdquo; for that is what it really consists of. In the towns of
Turkey the churches devote one day each week to the performance of this
rite, but in other churches it occurs at the end of a special mass, as
for example on Ascension Day, or on the commemoration day of St.
Gregory.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e2135src" href="#xd20e2135" name=
"xd20e2135src">10</a> There is always a very great gathering on this
occasion largely because of the various superstitions connected with
it. A large silver bowl of water is brought and placed on a stand at
the foot of the altar, after which the officiating priest comes forward
with relics of the Holy Cross, of the saints, or a simple silver cross
in his hand. The more frequently used relics are those of St. Gregory
the Illuminator, St. John the Baptist, St. James of Nisibis, or St.
George the Martyr. The priest reads prayers over the water, which are
answered by the chants from the choir, after which he dips the relic or
the cross into the water three times, finally making the sign of the
cross over the bowl. The Lord&rsquo;s prayer is repeated, after which a
ladle is placed on one side of the vessel, while the priest kneels on
the other, cross or relic in hand. Now the people crowd about, cross
their faces and kiss the cross, and then take up the ladle to drink of
the water thus blessed especially for drinking purposes. It is used
also for ablutions, for popular belief endows the sacred liquid with
curative power.</p>
<p>Some of the prayers that are repeated and the texts that are read
during this ceremony are well worth noting, for they illustrate the
candid interest of all participating. After the reading of the texts,
the deacon repeats the following proclamation: &ldquo;Let us pray unto
God who loveth <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb75" href="#pb75" name=
"pb75">75</a>]</span>mankind and hath given for hope and refuge his
victorious holy cross, which is armor invincible against the inworkings
of Satan, to the end that whatsoever it touches, this water and all
creatures. He shall through the same vouchsafe both healing and
mercy.&rdquo; The priest then prays: &ldquo;Bless, O Lord, this water,
and hallow it with thy holy cross, in order that the flocks and sheep
which may approach and drink of the same, may derive therefrom freedom
from disease and sterility; for from them we select sacrifices of
fragrant sweetness and offer them as victims to thyself.&rdquo; And
again the priest prays: &ldquo;Bless, O Lord, this water with the
life-giving powers of the cross that everyone who shall drink thereof
may derive therefrom a medicine of soul and body, and a health from the
diseases which afflict him.&rdquo; Again: &ldquo;Bless, O Lord, this
water with thy holy cross, that it may impart to the fields where it is
sprinkled profitable harvests, and that all plants and herbs may be
more than ever increased in fruitfulness.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e2142src" href="#xd20e2142" name="xd20e2142src">11</a> The cross
is then passed three times over the water with the words, &ldquo;Let
this water be blessed and hallowed in the name of the Father, and of
the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, Amen.&rdquo; This is followed by a
short proclamation by the deacon and a closing prayer by the priest,
after which the assembled people receive of the magic water as above
described.</p>
<p>This frank personal interest is characteristic of many of the church
ceremonies. For example in the sacrament of holy communion, incense is
offered with the prayer, &ldquo;Do thou in its stead send upon us the
graces and gifts of thine Holy Spirit.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e2150src" href="#xd20e2150" name="xd20e2150src">12</a></p>
<p>Of central importance to the nation as to the religion is the
ceremony of the consecration of the Katholikos, the supreme authority
of the church, which is held in front of the Cathedral at
Etchmiadzin.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e2164src" href="#xd20e2164"
name="xd20e2164src">13</a> People from near and far gather together to
witness this event, and lest they should fail to see the central act of
the ceremony, the roofs near-by are all used for the greater advantage
they give to the observer. The banner of the Katholikos is set flying
from the belfry tower; in front of the entrance to the Cathedral is set
a wooden dais covered with carpets and costly embroideries whereon the
ceremony is performed; the procession is formed and all is then in
readiness. A service is held in the Cathedral, after which the
procession issues from the church, and the various state and church
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb76" href="#pb76" name=
"pb76">76</a>]</span>officials including representatives from the
Russian government, the choir and deacons, all take their places about
the platform. The twelve bishops who reside at Etchmiadzin, and whose
business it is to wait upon the Katholikos, now appear gorgeously
attired, escorting the central figure of the day, over whose head two
attendants carry a richly embroidered canopy. The patriarch falls on
his knees, his feet beneath his body in full accordance with the
ordinary posture. One bishop now reads, after which another advances
bearing in his hands the image of a dove wrought in gold. It is the
receptacle of the holy oil, which is a mixture of the sacred oil
blessed by St. Gregory, sparingly used and carefully preserved in the
treasury of the Cathedral, and of the specially prepared oil
consecrated in Sis in Cilicia. While one bishop is pouring the holy oil
from the neck of the golden dove over the head of the <span class=
"corr" id="xd20e2169" title="Source: partiarch">patriarch</span>, the
other bishops gather around to spread the oil about with their thumbs,
making at the same time the sign of the cross. A piece of cloth is now
placed over his head, his face being covered at the same time by a veil
which is attached to the cloth. After a brief interval the newly
consecrated Katholikos, followed by the bishops, officials, and
procession, reenters the church in order to complete the ceremony. When
the procession again files out escorting the pontiff to his residence,
the choir sings, and the Russian band plays. Festivities continue
throughout the day and into the night, including mainly the banquet
with its toasts and songs by the choir, and the concert furnished by
the band in the evening. The band is a foreign innovation, although the
particular band observed by Lynch consisted mostly of Armenians.</p>
<p>The holy oil used in the consecration consists for the most part of
the preparation manufactured in Sis, as stated, and with which there is
a special ceremony connected, which is of general importance, for the
oil is also used for the various necessary consecrations of all the
churches. In the church at Sis is treasured a gorgeous silver bowl,
decorated with turrets and pinnacles, in which &ldquo;Muron&rdquo; as
it is called, or holy oil is made every four years. Pilgrims come from
far to witness the event. The bowl, which holds about a gallon of oil
is placed outside the church, and in it are placed a hundred and one
kinds of flowers amid prayers and chants.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e2175src" href="#xd20e2175" name="xd20e2175src">14</a> These
flowers are stirred with the arm of St. Gregory, after which the lid is
put on and the mixture made to boil.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e2183src" href="#xd20e2183" name="xd20e2183src">15</a> The
privilege of lifting off the lid is auctioned, and it is said that
&pound;100 was once paid for the distinction. The oil is then sold to
the pilgrims, all of whom take a phial of it along to their homes where
it is used in baptism, marriage, and burial ceremonies. It is also
believed to have wonderful medicinal properties. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb77" href="#pb77" name="pb77">77</a>]</span></p>
<p>The chief social value of these ceremonies lies in the fact that
they bring large groups of people together under unusual circumstances,
all of which adds importance to the various rites and festivities of
the occasion. Especially is this true of the consecration of the
Katholikos, which may occur twice or at the most three times in a
generation. For this reason and also because of the authority and
position of the Katholikos, not only as head of the church, but also in
a very real sense, as head of the nation, this ceremony is attended by
many pilgrims from the various sections of the country. Having
assembled, the occasion is thus made a great deal more of than if it
were an ordinary event. The day is a festival day in the full meaning
of the term. Besides the services there is the banquet, the special
choir, and the band. The relics kept in the treasury, which it is
probable that most people who come have not seen before; also the holy
churches of St. Gaiane and St. Rhipsime, which are visited by small
groups throughout the day; and most of all the sacred altar of the
Cathedral, where Christ descended in the vision of St. Gregory, are
special attractions. And then there is the library where many ancient
and precious manuscripts are exhibited, the institution of the
monastery, the garden of the Katholikos, the printing press, and the
seminary, all of which are of interest to the spectator. In fact there
is sufficient to induce the pilgrims to remain for a number of days,
which many of them do. The grounds are provided with a pilgrim&rsquo;s
court surrounded by guest chambers utilized at this time. Naturally
enough the various monuments suggest the traditions and legends with
which they are connected, such as the traditions of St. Gregory,
Tiridates, the legends of St. Rhipsime and St. Gaiane, and the other
legends associated with the introduction of Christianity. Although
centered about a religious ceremony which probably lasts no longer than
fifteen minutes, the occasion is thus made a festival, and is about as
important in fostering a real sentiment of patriotism and of church
loyalty as any other single festival.</p>
<p>The ceremony of the manufacture of the holy oil is not of such
central importance. It also, however, has the advantage of not
occurring very frequently, coming as it does only once in every four
years. This together with the general utility of the oil in all of the
various church ceremonies, plus the superstitions connected with it, is
sufficient to induce pilgrims to make the journey to Sis in Cilicia,
where the ceremony is held. It is again this assembly of pilgrims that
gives the ceremony a social importance. In a nation like the United
States where all parts are connected by railroads, telegraphs, and
telephones, such a pilgrimage would have comparatively little social
value. Except for government centers, there are no telegraphs in
Armenia, the telephone is known only in a few cities, and railroads
there are none. This lack of communication gives such ceremonies to
which pilgrimages are made a very special social value which
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb78" href="#pb78" name=
"pb78">78</a>]</span>they otherwise would not at all have. The
electoral assemblies spoken of have the same value, and for the same
reason. The Armenian is not a person to be silent, and talks even when
prudence is the better part of valour. He criticizes, condemns, and
praises openly, fearlessly, and carelessly, and such a gathering of
pilgrims, or electors, if it means anything, would mean a wholesale
exchange of facts relating to current events, opinions, and rumors with
reference to politics, religion, and every phase of social and
industrial life.</p>
<p>The Blessing of the Water can not be said to have so great a social
value, occurring as it does in some parts of the country once every
week. And yet this service is unusually well attended, largely because
of the superstitions connected with the blessed water. Religion here
appears to offer its biggest attraction to the less fortunate, such as
the rheumatic, the tubercular, the dyspeptic, the epileptic, and the
feeble-minded. But enough facts have been mentioned to show that the
Armenian church is something more than an institution of cure and
relief. It has identified itself too completely with the common life by
keeping alive the streams and cross currents of social activity to
admit of such a supposition.</p>
<p>The ceremony of Maundy Thursday, or Washing of the Feet, is, of the
four I have mentioned, of the least social importance. But it is
generally attended, especially by the women who are compelled by the
ban of custom to complete their house-cleaning before this service
begins. And then too, it is the commencement of the Easter celebration,
and as such has a distinct festival value. I have reviewed them
therefore in the order of their social importance. The consecration of
the Katholikos first; second the making of holy oil; third, the
Blessing of the Water, and finally, the Washing of the Feet, which
complete the second group of festivals. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

blessing or purifying of a well. A well is not used until a priest has
first blessed it, or if the water of a well becomes impure, it is
necessary to purify it by the blessing of a priest. The latter takes a
cross and a Bible and having requested the people to draw a pail of
water which is thrown away, a second pail is drawn, over which the
priest reads a psalm. The water is then blessed with the cross, incense
is burned over the well, and the pail of water is emptied back.

<h3 class="main">Section 1. Baptism</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The third group of festivals comprises those connected
with the common life of the people, including the ceremonies of
baptism, betrothal, marriage, and funeral. The church is vitally
related to each of them, and they are of importance here because of
their social value, which I shall again endeavor to point out.</p>
<p>First after birth, the most important event in the life of every
Armenian child is that of baptism, for the belief is that the
unbaptized child has no soul. The infant is therefore generally
baptized on the day after birth, and when this is impossible always
within eight days of birth. If the child is sick there is all the more
reason to hurry; in this case the essential parts of the ceremony are
performed in the home, the remainder being celebrated at the church at
some later time. The very first thing to be done therefore after the
birth of a child is to make the necessary preparations for baptism,
which are very elaborate in the case of the first-born, especially if
the child is a boy.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e2210src" href=
"#xd20e2210" name="xd20e2210src">1</a> A girl is always better than no
child at all, but not much better. A godfather and godmother are
selected, presents are exchanged between them and the parents of the
child, invitations are sent to friends and relations, and at a fixed
time the assembled people form a procession to the church, led by the
midwife holding the child. The godfather pays all expenses, and
therefore such splendor as the ceremony may have in the way of special
ornaments for the altar, numbers of priests, and a large choir, is
determined by him. After the group has properly assembled at the
church, the priest takes the child from the midwife and gives it to the
godfather. The profession of faith follows immediately and then the
priest turns to the west to abjure the devil and to the east to invoke
the Trinity.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e2215src" href="#xd20e2215"
name="xd20e2215src">2</a> Having placed the hem of his chasuble upon
the babe, the priest proceeds to the sacristy reciting a psalm, and
followed by the people. The central event now takes place. The baptism
consists of three immersions in the name of the Holy Trinity. First
water is poured over the head of the child, after which the whole body
is plunged into the water. Confirmation is administered right after the
ceremony of immersion, and takes place upon the altar of the church
proper, before the image of the Blessed Virgin. The forehead, eyes,
ears, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb80" href="#pb80" name=
"pb80">80</a>]</span>nose, mouth, hands, back, breast and upper part of
the feet of the infant are anointed with holy oil, and two wax tapers
are placed in the hands of the godfather while carrying the child. The
priest then takes the tapers and the babe, consecrates and confirms him
by three profound inclinations before the altar, gives candles and
child back to the godfather and blesses both. Now the child may be
called by its Christian name, which is usually that of a
saint.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e2228src" href="#xd20e2228" name=
"xd20e2228src">3</a> Led by the priest and the singing choir, the
procession now starts back to the home of the little one, still carried
by the godfather who continues to hold the candles. When he reaches the
door of the mother, she kneels and prostrates herself before him. He in
turn delivers the child to the mother&rsquo;s arms who may now kiss it
for the first time, the child not having been kissed by any one from
the moment of birth to the delivering over to the mother by the
godfather after baptism. Others may now also kiss the babe, and each
endeavors to be the first, for there is a superstitious value attached
to the first kiss following the mother&rsquo;s after baptism. The
priests and the family of the godfather spend the evening in the
child&rsquo;s home. They are served constantly by the father who does
not himself sit down. For forty days the mother must keep her room, and
walk only in such parts of the house as are exposed to the
sun.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e2231src" href="#xd20e2231" name=
"xd20e2231src">4</a> Having completed the fortieth day she and her babe
are taken to church by the grandmother.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e2235src" href="#xd20e2235" name="xd20e2235src">5</a> On this
occasion the young mother must bring an offering, which in times past
was a rich Persian rug, but is now merely a package of tapers. She
waits at the door of the sacristy until the priest comes and leads her
in before the high altar where both mother and child receive a
blessing. After this ceremony she must visit the godfather and kiss his
hand in token of gratitude.</p>
<p>If a funeral passes during the first forty days of the child&rsquo;s
life, the little one must be snatched up from the cradle and be carried
upright. People now come to offer their felicitations. The greeting of
the guest is always, &ldquo;May God raise the child in the shadow of
its parents,&rdquo; to which answer is given, &ldquo;May God bless you
according to your desire,&rdquo; or &ldquo;May your tongue be always in
good health.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 class="main">Section 2. Betrothal</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">It is the popular belief among Armenians that the
practice of early marriages dates from the proclamation of a Persian
shah of the sixteenth century, to whom part of Armenia was
tributary.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e2245src" href="#xd20e2245" name=
"xd20e2245src">6</a> This edict was intended <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb81" href="#pb81" name="pb81">81</a>]</span>to wipe
out Christianity, and provided for the marriage of Armenian boys and
girls with Persian children. In order to evade the edict, the Armenian
parents ran secretly from house to house for several nights marrying
off their children to each other. The custom on the part of the parents
of arranging for the marriage of their children without the knowledge
of the latter is supposed also to be rooted in this event. Whether the
explanation be true or not, it certainly is not uncommon for children
to marry at sixteen in the interior of Armenia, and it is still
generally true that arrangements for the marriages of children are made
without the knowledge of those most concerned.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e2253src" href="#xd20e2253" name="xd20e2253src">7</a> The girl
does occasionally exercise choice, but when the unfortunate suitor is
not desired by the parents the feeling of obligation on the
girl&rsquo;s part, simply because she has lived at her father&rsquo;s
table, is sufficient to induce her to submit.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd20e2256src" href="#xd20e2256" name="xd20e2256src">8</a> And the same
may be said of the young man, although the greater independence of a
son gives him a little more ground for acting contrary to his
father&rsquo;s wishes, than in the case of the daughter. But even when
the choice of the children is accepted, the arrangements and ceremony
of betrothal are always carried out by the parents.</p>
<p>These arrangements are something as follows. The parents of a young
man consult his grandparents, and choose a young girl who to them seems
eligible. They then inform a woman match-maker of their decision, and
it is her business to sound the ground, so to speak, before a proposal
is made, since a refusal would ruin the boy&rsquo;s reputation. The
matchmaker is often a professional woman, and can therefore be relied
upon not to make a bungle of the job. Among other things, she finds out
what gifts the bridegroom-to-be must make to his future bride, which
can of course be done only after the proposal has met with a favorable
response on the part of the parents of the girl. &ldquo;What can he
offer his bride,&rdquo; is the all important question from the
standpoint of the girl&rsquo;s family. Among the rich, but in times
past, gold bracelets bejeweled with diamonds or strings of gold pieces
for adorning the head or neck were common varieties of gifts. To-day
silver plate, or expensive heirlooms are given. After these matters
have been decided upon, preparations are made for the ceremony of
betrothal, usually held in the evening. The friends of the young man
are notified to meet together in his house at an appointed hour with
the priest who is given a ring which he blesses. The procession of the
bridegroom&rsquo;s friends headed by the priest now starts for the
house of the bride. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb82" href="#pb82"
name="pb82">82</a>]</span>All are provided with lighted wax candles
which they hold in their hands as they proceed down the streets
accompanied by the sound of violin, clarinets, drum, and joyful
singing. Sometimes a detour is made in order to lengthen the
procession.</p>
<p>Having arrived at their destination, the father and mother of the
girl pretend to know nothing whatever of the reason for the coming of
the guests, and conversation proceeds for a considerable time without
the slightest allusion to the matter of chief moment. The priest
finally makes the following statement amid profound silence:
&ldquo;According to the law of the supreme Creator, and following the
usages of human society, we have the happiness of demanding the hand of
Miss X, for Mr. Y.&rdquo; The father of the girl pretends not to wish
to accept, stating that she is too young, or that her mother is very
desirous to keep her at home. But upon further pressing on the part of
the parents of the boy, the acceptance is given. It is now the turn of
the girl to be consulted; she, however, is nowhere to be found. The
priest searches, and when finally discovered she does not speak a word.
The former, however, knows, and offering his hand he says, &ldquo;If
you consent, kiss the hand,&rdquo; which is straightway done, for the
girl has been informed beforehand that the kiss is to be forthcoming.
This part of the procedure takes place apart from the crowd, and is
followed by the presentation of the ring and the benediction which must
take place before the public. But since custom forbids the girl to
appear during the entire evening, a brother or a sister comes forward
and kneels before the priest to receive the ring. The rest all kneel at
the same time, and the priest gives the benediction. The ring is
carried by the child to the fianc&eacute;e, the health of the couple is
drunk in rose-syrup, and congratulations and compliments are exchanged.
Whatever else is eaten or drunk, rose-syrup must be at hand, for this
is essential and peculiar to the ceremony.</p>
<p>All this while the young man is within the walls of his own home.
Custom forbids him to appear at the house of his bride-to-be until the
wedding day, and if perchance the two should meet, he must turn his
head away while she hides herself. Towards ten o&rsquo;clock the party
breaks up, and each guest is given a wax candle. All try to steal
something from the house before leaving, such as a bottle, a glass, or
a spoon, and if the thieves are not caught before they leave the house,
the articles are returned only at the price of a supper from the head
of the family. The party now returns to the home of the future
bridegroom, accompanied by the friends and relatives of the girl. The
procession formed, there is the same lighting of wax candles received
from the host, brightening the otherwise darkened streets, and the same
music and singing to triumph over the silence of the night. The young
man must stand upright before his future father-in-law all through the
visit. For him the great moment comes when the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb83" href="#pb83" name="pb83">83</a>]</span>brother
of his fianc&eacute;e takes him aside and offers him a glass of syrup
prepared by her own hands. The whole night is passed in song and
amusement. During the following fortnight both families receive visits
of congratulation, and at every visit the host or hostess must offer
the syrup drunk at the betrothal ceremony.</p>

<h3 class="main">Section 3. Marriage</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Elaborate and gay as are the festivities of betrothal,
the celebrations of marriage are so much more so that one is inclined
to look upon the essential religious ceremony as a pretext for the
merry-making.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e2285src" href="#xd20e2285"
name="xd20e2285src">9</a> The interval of a month which ordinarily
intervenes between engagement and marriage is devoted to making the
necessary preparations for the wedding. The bridegroom must get ready
the promised ornaments, a white wedding-dress for his bride, a fine
veil to cover her face, and a pair of shoes, a rather strange
combination of gifts. One wonders also why the necessary gloves and
silk stockings are not included. The young lady on her part prepares
her trousseau including garments of various sorts, bits of jewelry, a
wooden chest filled with her clothing, a mirror, a nuptial bed with the
necessary accessories, and a few cooking utensils; altogether an outfit
quite as varied and singular as the gifts of the bridegroom, but
certainly practical and sensible enough. Two days before the wedding,
which usually occurs on a Sunday afternoon, invitations are sent out to
friends and relatives, and musicians are secured. On the eve of the
ceremony, the godfather invites the bridegroom with his friends to a
Turkish bath, where they go to the accompaniment of music and singing.
This part of the celebration is full of laughter and song, and is
continued on the forenoon of the next day in the home of the
bridegroom, when the barber comes to shave him in the presence of the
guests and musicians, who sing and play as on the preceding evening at
the bath. The occasion is one of importance for the barber, who brings
all sorts of perfumes which are purchased by the guests and poured over
the bridegroom; he receives not only a large fee for his service but
also a double price for the scented extracts. The young man is then
dressed up while the priest and choir children who have arrived sing
canticles.</p>
<p>In the meantime very similar festivities occur in the home of the
bride, participated in by her young girl friends and relatives, except
that they are not characterized by the same spirit of loud laughter and
rejoicing. On the eve of the wedding the girls gather around her to
sing melancholy songs, in considerable contrast with the gay, spirited
music and singing taking place in the Turkish bath at the same time.
Having shared the sadness, they place a rose leaf on the palm of each
hand of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb84" href="#pb84" name=
"pb84">84</a>]</span>bride, which is covered with henneh, a green
Persian powder made into paste, after which each hand is carefully
bandaged up. So the poor sad girl must go to bed, to sleep if she can.
On the next morning her friends again arrive to take the bandages off
her hands, to dress her, and to sing and dance about her. Except for
the print of the rose leaf, the henneh leaves the hands orange red,
which is supposed to be beautiful. The songs and dancing are again of a
decidedly melancholy tone. Her white dress, together with the coat of
the bridegroom, must be blessed by the priest, a ceremony which the
church functionary performs alone, both articles being sent to him
early in the morning. Preliminary to the day&rsquo;s events, and before
breakfast, both bride and bridegroom, being previously confessed, go
separately to church, where they take communion. This done, the
festivities described follow, bride and bridegroom are dressed, and all
is in readiness for the ceremony which occurs in the late afternoon or
evening.</p>
<p>The bride must ride to church on horseback, and having arrived she
is dismounted, and later remounted without touching her feet to the
ground, which rather cumbersome performance is accomplished through the
help of a brother or relative, who also rides the bride&rsquo;s steed
while the ceremony takes place within, for the horse is not to be left
riderless. The procession to the church is accompanied by musicians.
Before the rail which separates the choir from the body of the church,
two wooden chairs are placed, upon which the couple sit down while the
people present kneel on the mats covering the floor. When the time
comes for the blessing of the priest, the couple arise, step inside the
choir space, and stand facing each other between the high altar and two
witnesses, their foreheads touching. In this position they receive the
sacrament of matrimony, answering in the affirmative the questions of
the priest regarding their duties to each other and to their children.
Of the bride is demanded perfect faithfulness to conjugal duties,
entire obedience to the husband of whom care, patience, wisdom, and
love are required. The priest, taking the right hand of the bride and
placing it in the hand of the bridegroom, says, &ldquo;According to the
divine order God gave to our ancestors, I give thee now this wife in
subjection. Wilt thou be her master?&rdquo; &ldquo;Through the help of
God I will,&rdquo; answers the bridegroom. The priest then asks the
woman, &ldquo;Wilt thou be obedient to him?&rdquo; to which is
answered, &ldquo;I am obedient according to the order of God.&rdquo;
These questions are repeated and replied to thrice, in evident implicit
belief that once would not be sufficient. Finally, the priest ties to
each of their heads a cord and cross, which is again removed by him
late at night in the home with special ceremony, and it is only after
this performance that the couple may enter the nuptial chamber.</p>
<p>After the ceremony at the church the procession starts back for the
home of the bridegroom&rsquo;s father, the bride riding upon her horse,
musician <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb85" href="#pb85" name=
"pb85">85</a>]</span>playing, and choir boys singing. The
water-carriers, who have supplied drinking water, break their jars
noisily before the bridegroom, drenching his marriage costume and
giving rather an abrupt signal to the godfather whose business it is to
tip them. Noisily the procession moves along the streets until it
arrives at the gate of the house. In days past it was the custom at
this point in the ceremony to place a sheep ready to be sacrificed at
the feet of the young couple, the poorer people contenting themselves
with chickens. The butcher put his knife to the neck of the sheep
saying, &ldquo;May God thus put all your enemies under your feet, Amen,
Amen.&rdquo; Then pieces of coin mixed with raisins, pistachios, and
other bits of nuts or dried fruits are showered over the people from
the windows above, while the godfather leads the bridegroom within to
the crowd of men, and the godmother leads the bride to the women,
everybody trying to kiss the cross on their heads. The bride is then
placed in the seat of honor and in her arms is laid first a little boy,
and then a little girl, so that the first child may be a boy and if
perchance the will of God be otherwise at least a girl. Each guest now
comes to the bride to place at her feet a fruit in season. The
bridegroom is called &ldquo;the prince of the feast&rdquo; and must
never quit his seat of honor. If he does leave his chair he must place
an object belonging to him upon his seat, and if he should at any time
omit to do so, the assembly makes the godfather pay the necessary
forfeit, which is usually a dinner. Towards nine, the guests take their
leave, having eaten and sung to their uttermost desire.<a class=

<p>Living in the home of her patriarchal father-in-law, the young wife
is subject to the severest restraints. She must wear a lightly fitting
veil enclosing her face below the eyes, without which she can not
appear even in the house.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e2306src" href=
"#xd20e2306" name="xd20e2306src">11</a> She wears a close fitting
bodice fastened at the neck with silver clasps, full trousers of rose
colored silk gathered in at the ankles by a filet of silver; her feet
are bare, a silver girdle of curious workmanship loosely encircles her
waist, and a long padded garment, open down the front, hangs from her
shoulders. Not a single word must she utter to any member of the
household, except when alone with her husband, and then only such as
may be absolutely necessary, until she has given birth to her first
child. Then she may speak to her nursling, after a while to her
mother-in-law, later to her own mother, and by and by to the young
girls of the household, but never in all her life may she have word
with a young man not a relative. During her first year of married life,
she may not go out of the house except for two visits to the church.
Every morning and at <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb86" href="#pb86"
name="pb86">86</a>]</span>the end of each meal she must pour water over
the hands of her father- and mother-in-law, and for a certain time
after marriage, when visitors come, she must kiss their hands, except
of course, for men, before whom she may not even appear.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd20e2311src" href="#xd20e2311" name=
"xd20e2311src">12</a> Apart from these troublesome restraints the young
wife is treated with the utmost solicitude, and in some parts, even the
peasant wife is not allowed to do outdoor work. In the mountain
villages of Persian Armenia, however, the women do all the tilling in
the fields, wearing their veils over their mouths as they
work.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e2317src" href="#xd20e2317" name=
"xd20e2317src">13</a> The author here quoted states that husbands never
see the mouths of their wives, who not only must not speak during the
first year of married life, or until a child is born, but also may not
converse freely with their husbands until six years of married life
have elapsed.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e2323src" href="#xd20e2323"
name="xd20e2323src">14</a></p>
<p>In such fashion the sanctity of the marriage relation is strictly
guarded, and as one would suppose, illegitimate births are unknown in
Armenia. Intermarriage among relations is forbidden, and until recent
years, divorce has been unknown.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e2328src"
href="#xd20e2328" name="xd20e2328src">15</a> As for the taboo on
speech, it is calculated not so much as an inducement to the production
of offspring as to preserve harmonious relations between the various
members of the patriarchal household. Even the patriarch with all his
authority would find difficulty in preserving proper decorum of speech
and manners in so heterogeneous a household, if every newly acquired
daughter-in-law were given a free rein in the use of her tongue. As the
neophyte is made to understand his position by a brutal initiation, so
the young wife is kept from assuming command over the female household
by the placing of a moral valuation upon the silence which alone is
compatible with the essential modesty regarded as the first and chief
of virtues among wives. In the household of the patriarch there is a
great deal to be done in common, and unfortunately the occasion for
mutual aid is not sufficient to bring about the desired
co&ouml;peration. Hence singleness of command and authority is a
necessary condition, not only of efficiency, but also of peace, for it
can not be supposed that so many daughters-in-law would work together
in harmony. It would be a mistake, therefore, to regard the customary
silence as an inducement to child-bearing.</p>
<p>Identifying itself with the common events of life, such as birth,
marriage, and death, the church has not only given a religious meaning
to these occasions but has also sanctioned and even encouraged the
festivities that accompany them. These festivities have up to this
point been <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb87" href="#pb87" name=
"pb87">87</a>]</span>occasions for rejoicing, with the single and
significant exception of the melancholy singing of the bride&rsquo;s
friends on the eve and day of her wedding. There is a perfect
naturalness about all the merry-making and festivals so far considered,
and this is no less characteristic of the funeral celebrations now to
be taken up. The description of these will conclude my treatment of the
last group of festivals, which are more properly festival-ceremonies,
or ceremonies that have been made the occasion of festivity.</p>

<h3 class="main">Section 4. Funeral</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The funerals, as one would naturally suppose, are more
ceremonious, more ritualistic, and although there is now generally a
minimum of festivity connected with them, this has not always been
so.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e2343src" href="#xd20e2343" name=
"xd20e2343src">16</a> When the condition of a sick person is beyond
hope, the priest is notified and the person is given confession,
communion, and extreme unction. After death the eyes and mouth are
closed, the body washed and dressed up in the newest and cleanest
clothes to be had, and the arms crossed on the breast.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd20e2349src" href="#xd20e2349" name=
"xd20e2349src">17</a> Two candles are kept burning until the day of the
funeral, one at the foot and one at the head of the coffin. Sad, wooden
bells are sounded, and guests are invited to pay their last respects.
Coffee is served to them, but without sugar, as a sign of grief.
Mourning women are secured, who eulogize the departed and weep and
lament until the priests begin their chanting. The corpse is now taken
to the church in a special coffin which is covered with a black velvet
cloth adorned with small white crosses, among the wealthy, but among
the poor the body is wrapped in linen and laid in a simple bier,
carried by relatives and friends. At the head of the procession, which
marches very slowly and chants on the way, there are carried a great
cross and two lighted torches, followed by the priests and then by the
coffin. The passer-by must stop and cross himself many times. At the
church the coffin is laid down, and if the relatives are wealthy each
person in the church is provided with a small wax candle which is kept
lighted during the service. While the ceremony proceeds the body is
blessed with holy water and perfumed with incense, after which the
procession re-forms to accompany the body to the cemetery. The chanting
is kept up all the way. At the cemetery the body is lowered into its
last resting-place, and the priest, after making the sign of the cross
on the four corners of the grave, throws three shovelfuls of earth into
it and three more on the coffin. The people imitate by throwing three
handfuls of dust, and the ceremony completed, all return to the home of
the deceased where they <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb88" href=
"#pb88" name="pb88">88</a>]</span>partake of steaming broth prepared by
the neighbors and friends, and recite prayers for the soul of the dead.
This latter practice, as said before, is a pagan survival, as is also
the chanting of mass for the departed, which occurs three days later,
at which time broth is again distributed, but this time to the poor as
a sacrifice to the dead. The grave is blessed on the third day, again
on the ninth, at the close of the third month, and for the last time,
at the close of the year.</p>
<p>The funeral of a priest is performed with much splendor.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd20e2356src" href="#xd20e2356" name=
"xd20e2356src">18</a> The procession makes a circuit of all the
churches, and stopping at different places, portions of the gospel are
read. If the priest be of high rank, as an archbishop, or a bishop, he
is carried in an open coffin and in a sitting posture, dressed up in
official vestments, in which position he is interred in the courtyard
of the church. Farmers send sheep to be killed and given to the poor as
a sacrifice. The Greeks in Constantinople also carry their dead in an
open coffin, but this is because a Greek official who was a refugee
prisoner in Constantinople at the time of the war of the Turks with the
Greeks, endeavored to get himself carried out of the country by
feigning death and boxing himself up in a coffin. But the Turks
discovered the ruse and it was enacted by the sultan that thereafter
all Greeks must be carried to their graves in open coffins. The custom
in respect to the Armenian bishops, however, has no connection with
this.</p>
<p>In some parts of Armenia, as for example in Erzerum, the snow lies
so deep in winter-time that burial is well-nigh impossible. During
spring-time, with the melting of the snow, coffins have been found
perched up on tree tops. This was related by an Armenian boy I know of,
who lived in the vicinity of Erzerum. Curious customs of the past have
left their marks. In Tarsus, for example, there are Armenian graves
ranged about a tree which is asserted to have been planted by St. Paul,
each provided with a stone upon which has been carved a symbol of the
deceased, for the merchant, a representation of weights and measures,
for the blacksmith, an anvil and hammer, for the scribe, an inkstand
and pen, and for the industrious housewife, a distaff and spindle. In
the cemetery of Nakhitchevan is a large building in which the mourners
have a great repast after the funeral, and in certain other graveyards,
Dubois found innumerable pieces of broken pitchers and crockery, which
were probably broken, as the custom is, to ward off the evil spirit of
the dead.</p>
<p>These four ceremonies complete the third and last group of festivals
described. I have called them ceremonies because fundamentally that is
what they are, but they are to be distinguished sharply from the many
church ceremonies I have not so much as mentioned, by reason
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb89" href="#pb89" name=
"pb89">89</a>]</span>of their festival or social value which alone
makes them proper subject-matter for this thesis. The relation between
these ceremonies as revealed in the common procession, as well as in
the religious ceremony necessary to each is due largely to the fact
that they have to do with the most ordinary, and yet most extraordinary
of life&rsquo;s events, birth, betrothal, marriage, and death.</p>
<p>Reviewing them from the standpoint of their social or festival
value, it is obvious that the marriage celebration easily takes first
place, the betrothal festivities second, baptism and funeral third.
There is the rather uncouth, perhaps, but none the less spontaneous
gaiety of the friends of the bridegroom, not only on the eve of the
wedding-day when they go to the bath, but also on the morning of the
wedding-day when the unfortunate youth is assuredly cured of any
addiction he might have to the use of perfumes. I should imagine that
the music would begin to bore the young men by the time the barber
arrives, since the musicians also accompany the rejoicing of the night
before, and yet it may be said that there could be nothing more
convenient or ingenious devised to carry over a lull in the
merry-making, for after all, the young men could not well be singing,
joking, laughing, and teasing all the time. In striking contrast is the
melancholy rejoicing of the party of young women at the home of the
bride. But where there is dancing and singing there can not well be
weeping, although no doubt it is more natural for the bride to be
thoughtful on her wedding-day, than for the bridegroom, for it is the
former who leaves her home to spend the rest of her days in a very new,
very strange, perhaps even unkindly world. There is still another
reason for the melancholy, in that the girl must know she is bidding
farewell forever to the delights and joys and freedom of childhood, for
although to-day she may speak and sing and make merry, to-morrow
morning she must be silent and prepared to pour water over the hands of
her father- and mother-in-law. Henceforth it is for her to be
submissive, obedient, docile, uncomplaining even at heart, for what use
will it be to complain, and though her most cherished dreams may be of
motherhood, does she not also have spirit, and why must it be broken?
Is she then only a chattel to be sold into everlasting bondage? It is
all too evident, even to the dullest of brides, that the happiness of
childhood is forever past, and the brighter one can hardly fail to feel
that she has been bartered for the bit of gold about her waist or
neck.</p>
<p>There is then the very highest of social value to be attributed to
both of these festivities, and largely because in each group of people,
the young men on one side, the young women on the other, there is
perfect community of feeling, mutual understanding, and freedom of
thought and expression. In comparison with these gatherings, the mixed
assembly at the house of the bridegroom after the marriage ceremony is
of little importance. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb90" href="#pb90"
name="pb90">90</a>]</span>The succession of events covering a period of
nearly thirty-six hours, of which only a few, and perhaps none at all,
are spent in sleep by the members of the bridal party, must certainly
begin to have its effect by the time the little baby doll is placed in
the lap of the bride.</p>
<p>The betrothal party is always out for a good time, for they realize
that the merry-making is to be an all-night affair. There is the
procession with its candles lighting up the darkened streets, the music
and singing filling all space, the humorous little artificialities in
the house of the bride,&mdash;real enough, at least ceremoniously, from
the standpoint of the family,&mdash;the syrup, the attempted stealing
of utensils, the return procession, the singing, music, and dancing at
the home of the young bridegroom-to-be, without stop until dawn. All of
this makes a rather complete occasion, even for young people.</p>
<p>Baptism and funeral rites come nearest being pure ceremonies. But
even the baptismal rite has its procession to and from the church
participated in by all the friends and relatives of the family, and
though the event is an occasion neither for rejoicing nor for sorrow,
it is important enough, occurring as it does but once in the lifetime
of each individual. There are, to be sure, the social calls that follow
the ceremony. But the event can not be said to have any attraction for
the young; and if this is true of baptism, it is still more true of
funerals. Nevertheless there is the distinct psychological value of
each, calling up as they do various associations, as the baptism of
this one, or the death of another one, and thus keeping alive the
deepest experiences of life. If they are crude and offensive to more
delicate tastes, it must be remembered that a belief is represented in
the concrete fashion essential to the simple mind, a mode of
representation necessary to the best of intellects even though on
another plane. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb91" href="#pb91" name=

According to <i>Maschtotz</i> the devil is abjured and the Trinity
invoked at the gate of the church. In the course of the ceremony the
priest unclothes the babe and asks the godfather, &ldquo;What seeks the

Baptism, to be cleansed from his sins and to be freed from the

Tavernier states that in Persian Armenia a man frequently lives with
his wife ten years without ever hearing her voice or seeing her face.
Of course she does not sleep with her veil over her face, but she is

she is to rise before daybreak in order to put it on again. (Tavernier

<h2 class="main">Summary</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Such are the festivals treated in the second and last
part of this thesis. Is it true that they form a vehicle of expression
for the national sentiment created by the large mass of social material
of which the legends of Part One are a considerable and important
portion? Again it will be necessary to remind ourselves of the chief
sentiments included within Armenian national sentiment, i.e., the
sentiment of loyalty to the church, the sentiment of reverence
amounting almost to worship for the ancient glory of the nation, and
the sentiment of love for the country. It would be ridiculous to
suppose that every festival was designed to give expression to some one
of these sentiments. But that these sentiments are given very clear,
very real outward expression in the great majority of the celebrations
described, should be so evident at this point as to make further
exposition unnecessary. In the summer Festival of Vartavar, the spring
Festival of Mihr, Vartan&rsquo;s Day, and in the consecration of the
Katholikos there is the proud and reverent looking back to the times
when Armenia was an independent nation; the festival ceremonies of the
third group, baptism, betrothal, marriage, and funeral, though they are
not positive expressions of the sentiments of loyalty to the church,
are yet so completely interwoven with the church and dependent upon it
that one is compelled to regard the feeling as something to be taken
for granted, while in most of the festivals of the second group,
Christmas, Easter, Maundy Thursday, and the Blessing of the Grapes
especially, the sentiment is given a more positive expression. As for
the sentiment of love for the country, that is identified especially
with Vartavar and Vartan&rsquo;s Day. It is evident, therefore, that
each of these festivals and festival-ceremonies forms a medium more or
less evident as the case may be, for the expression of one or more or
all of the sentiments that make up Armenian national sentiment. Some of
them are not to be classified as readily as this, as for example, the
festival of Ascension morning, or Fortune-Telling Day, in which the
dominant sentiment is one of romantic love, or in the Blessing of the
Water, where the desire for a gain in health or wealth is the main
psychological fact.</p>
<p>Each one of these festivals, however, is a great deal more than the
putting into activity of some of the above sentiments. In many of them
the play-instinct is clearly evident, while in a few such as Vartavar,
the whole self, with all its sentiments, instincts, tendencies, and
emotions, is given the fullest and most unrestrained freedom. A
festival, if it is anything, is a letting loose of the reins; there is
nothing to hinder, nothing <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb92" href=
"#pb92" name="pb92">92</a>]</span>to keep back, nothing to hide,
nothing to fear, and the self reaches out in a higher consciousness of
fullness and completeness of living. As such it would be the greatest
of fallacies to suppose any one of the festivals to be restricted to a
particular sentiment. Nevertheless, it is clear, that the festivals do
constitute vehicles of expression for the sentiments that make up
Armenian national sentiment.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Conclusions</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The general conclusions to which this study
unmistakably gives rise are in respect to the national traits of the
Armenian people. These traits have been brought out both explicitly and
implicitly in connection with the various legends and festivals
considered, and it is my purpose, therefore, to summarize and
substantiate them at this point. They include, first, the
superstitiousness, second, the conservatism, third, the
self-sufficiency, and lastly the familism of the people.</p>
<p>First of these qualities, superstitiousness, may be ascribed in
large measure to geographical isolation. The country to be sure, is so
situated as to form a highway from Europe to the Mesopotamian valley,
and from Asiatic Russia to the Mediterranean, and although it has been
overrun by Assyrians, Greeks, Parthians, Romans, Persians, Turks,
Egyptians, and still others, yet we must speak of it as isolated, for
the science that has brought remote countries into contact has not
affected Armenia to any considerable degree. Subject to a backward
nation, lacking all modern means of communication, the country is shut
off and the plows of civilization have not yet furrowed the social soil
of superstition. How general these superstitions are is brought out
especially by the festivals described, many of which have given rise to
a superstition or a group of superstitions. From Vartavar, there came
the belief that the dust from the sacred altar served as a talisman for
children learning their A B C&rsquo;s; the spring fire festival gave
rise to the practice of taking home a glowing brand for good luck;
there is the belief that the blessed water will cure various diseases,
and that the oil scraped from the anointed foot with a walnut given by
the priest after washing the feet at the ceremony of Maundy Thursday,
will keep a supply of butter throughout the year. And then there are
the beliefs in the miraculous power of the holy oil, manufactured with
due ceremony every four years at Sis; in the healing power of the
various sacred relics kept at Etchmiadzin and other places, and ten
thousand others. There are also beliefs not of a religious character as
the above, such as the one in regard to the tetagush, the little
locust-eating bird, which is supposed to be attracted by Ararat spring
water. The same superstition obtains in other parts of the country with
the difference that the inconvenience of obtaining Ararat spring water
makes it necessary for the people to believe in the peculiar efficacy
of other springs. These <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb93" href=
"#pb93" name="pb93">93</a>]</span>illustrations are sufficient, and
although it could hardly be proved that Armenians are more innately
superstitious than the Anglo-Saxon ancestors who believed only a few
generations ago in the power of the malignant eye, and that an innocent
person might pass through fire unharmed, yet their superstitious nature
and beliefs are present-day facts explained most completely on the
ground of comparative isolation from the rest of the world.</p>
<p>Second of the national characteristics of the people clearly brought
out by this study is their conservatism. This may also be traced in
large measure to their secluded condition, but in larger proportion is
it due to the solidarity and national consciousness, which naturally
consider innovations as foreign, and intrusions of foreign cultures,
ideals, customs, and manners as hostile. That this is true is indicated
conclusively by the fact that in Constantinople, where Armenian culture
has naturally come in conflict with that of the Greek, the Turk, and
the European, the Armenians have not at all given up their ways to
imitate any of the three peoples mentioned. To be sure they have not
adhered rigidly to the old beliefs and practices of the interior.
Comparison has resulted in substitution, and conflict between the
rational and irrational, the utile and the inutile, has meant
displacement, but invariably by something distinctly different from the
usages and practices current among Turk or European. That is, Armenians
are themselves centers of imitation by fellow Armenians who, though
they follow the lines suggested by their fellow countrymen, scorn to
imitate even the European, whose superiority is generally recognized in
Constantinople. The Armenian, recognizing no superior, has merely
modified his own practices, usages, manners, and customs to suit his
changed environment. And therefore I say that the characteristic
Armenian conservatism is due rather to a strong feeling of nationality
than to isolation.</p>
<p>The conservatism of the church has been an important element.
Refusing to have anything to do with the decisions of the Council of
Chalcedon, the church became independent and has maintained a policy of
the most rigid ultra-conservatism ever since. Says Ormanian:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">The Armenian church would have nothing to do with this
transaction (Chalcedon) which was prompted by a design that had no
bearing on theology. She remained firm in her original resolve, and
ever maintained an attitude of ultra-conservatism. She set herself to
resist every new dogmatic utterance said to emanate from revelation, as
well as every innovation which could in any way pervert the primitive
faith.<a class="noteref" id="xd20e2406src" href="#xd20e2406" name=
"xd20e2406src">1</a></p>
</div>
<p>That this same spirit is reflected in the social life of the people
is something one would naturally expect, in view of the important
influence of the church over the entire life of the people. As the
father of the Alan princess <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb94" href=
"#pb94" name="pb94">94</a>]</span>replied when requested to give the
hand of his daughter to Artasches, &ldquo;From whence shall brave
Artasches give thousands upon thousands and ten thousands upon tens of
thousands unto the Alans in return for the maiden?&rdquo; so to-day the
first question that is asked when the hand of a young Armenian girl is
requested in marriage is &ldquo;What can he give for his bride?&rdquo;
The practice of wife purchase has only changed in that the required
riches are given to the bride instead of to the father of the bride.
Occasionally a young man is pressed to the point of mortgaging property
in order to obtain the necessary funds, and it has been known that in
many such cases the young bride found her treasure gone shortly after
her marriage, her master having taken it to pay off his mortgage. So
parents arrange for the marriage of their children, the young wife is
delivered up to her husband as the obedient and submissive servant,
children are baptized after they have scarcely opened their eyes, and
church ceremonies are conducted much as they have been for
generations.</p>
<p>The self-sufficiency of the Armenian people has been indicated in
the repeated failures of missionary religions and foreign cultures to
alter appreciably the native folkways and mores. In spite of political
subordination to Islam, the Gregorian church has held tenaciously to
its ideals and has successfully maintained its independence. The
distinctive social tradition,&mdash;which includes the political and
the religious traditions,&mdash;has remained intact in the face of
recurrent invasion, vassalage, and persecution. The Armenian will not
be assimilated. Death is preferable to the loss of those intangible
realities that make the people a distinctive group. When Haic, the
patriarchal progenitor of the race, was invited to &ldquo;soften his
hard pride,&rdquo; and to return to the kingdom of the god Bel, the
alternative, war, was chosen. In the year 450, when the Persian
fire-worshippers invited the Armenians to change their faith, the
answer again was war. The reply to the decision of Chalcedon
illustrates the same spirit. Likewise through the centuries of the
immediate past the ever recurring answer to the Turk has been war.
Powerless to assimilate the Armenian people, the Turk has had to
annihilate or be annihilated. The self-sufficiency of the people thus
reveals itself in the will to maintain the distinctive social
tradition, regardless of cost or sacrifice.</p>
<p>The characteristic familism reveals itself not only in the customs
of family life, but also in the very nature of the Armenian. In Russian
Armenia there is a very active propaganda carried on by Russian girls
to secure Armenian husbands because of the domesticity of the latter,
which is in striking contrast to the adventurous unfaithfulness of the
Russian husband, whose house becomes his prison, from which he
therefore flees, leaving his wife and children to shift for themselves.
The discontented Russian may be a more attractive lover for his
&ldquo;Wanderlust&rdquo; and restlessness, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb95" href="#pb95" name="pb95">95</a>]</span>but he
is a less attractive husband for the same reason. An Armenian husband
belongs in his home, where he lives in the hope that some day he may be
the father of a huge household of married sons and grandsons. A young
Armenian I know spoke to me of his wish that some day his father might
collect the scattered sons and unite them and their families in a
single household. This desire is so general among Armenians as to make
it evident that the family is the all-important social unit. No
reputation is so great as that carried by a good family name, nor is
there any so damning as that which goes with a bad family name. And why
is the young bride kept silent for years if not to ensure the
all-essential family-unity, family-solidarity, and
family-continuity,&mdash;that is, continuity of family tradition,
manners, and customs? And why is the &ldquo;patria-potestas&rdquo;
well-nigh unlimited if not for precisely the same reason? Nor is the
taboo upon the young bride, according to which she may not speak to any
young man not a relative during her entire life of marriage, of no
significance in this connection. It too precludes family disruption, or
blemish on the family name. Divorce and infidelity are very rare, all
family differences having no tribunal outside the patriarch, who
considers his greatest misfortune to be a lack of family integrity or
oneness. Thus a son who has been swayed by Protestantism dares not
clash with his father, and has no choice but to run away, while a
daughter whose wishes are contrary can be disobedient only at the cost
of breaking the family connection, to prevent which she is usually
ready to make any sacrifice. All of this is no accident. Forced to
dwell within the circle of the family group for seven, eight, or nine
months during the year without so much as opening his door, because of
the severity of winter, the life of the patriarch is inevitably
centered in his household, and therefore also the self of each member
is merged into the larger unit. This familism throws additional light
on some of the conclusions I have insisted upon, for nothing so fosters
conservatism as a substantial family solidarity; what could be more
instrumental in passing on the national sentiment, and finally, what
could be more favorable to the development of the self-sufficiency, the
independence of Armenian character? In speaking of &ldquo;familism and
the well-knit family&rdquo; Ross says; &ldquo;Worshippers of the spirit
of the hearth, they are more aloof from their fellows, slower therefore
to merge with them or be swept from their moorings by them. It seems to
be communion by the fire-side rather than communion in the public
resort that gives individuality long bracing roots. The withdrawn
social self, although it lacks breadth, gains in depth,
etc.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd20e2419src" href="#xd20e2419" name=
"xd20e2419src">2</a></p>
<p>Any socially well-knit people possessing a distinctive social
tradition, and characterized by a highly developed national
consciousness, may make its contribution to the world&rsquo;s work, if
it is given the necessary freedom. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb96"
href="#pb96" name="pb96">96</a>]</span>As the period of the Arsacidae
kings brought forth the golden age of Armenian literature, so greater
achievements may follow the political independence that is hoped for,
and for which Armenians have valiantly struggled. Lord Bryce writes of
the Armenian race, &ldquo;It is the only one of the native races of
Western Asia that is capable of restoring productive industry and
assured prosperity to the now desolate region that was the earliest
home of civilization.&rdquo; In the past, the energy of the people has
been wasted in ceaseless conflict. Given a guarantee of territorial
integrity, and participation in the affairs of government with the hope
of future autonomy, the energies of strife will be diverted to the work
of peace. Not until then can the high calling expressed in the words of
Lord Bryce be realized. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb97" href=

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
